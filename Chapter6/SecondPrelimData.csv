It's only been 30 secs and the umpires are already helping @Richmond_FC!! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:52^U
This looks ominous. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:52^U
Tough start for my western Sydney wanderers. C'mon boys, let's get some handballs and get back in this! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:53^U
I'm sure the speech from LC was, start well, don't let the crowd get into it early #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:17:54^U
Faaaaark, let's go Tigers! #AFLTigersGiants Dustin two score involvements already. #beast^2017-09-23 16:17:55^U
2 free kicks, 2 goals. Richmond are the Bulldogs of last year. Good luck GWS. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:55^U
@timontrack Richmond are favourites to win the flag in the big dance! #AFLTigersGiants 🇦🇺💃^2017-09-23 16:17:54^U
Wow what a start #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:55^U
And they're off to a flying start! #AFLTigersGiants @Davelennonabc^2017-09-23 16:17:55^U
Fuck me it’s loud. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:55^U
Holy shit, goal in about 16 seconds for the Tigers and another inside the first minute. Wow, go Tigers. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:56^U
Even I, a tragic Demon, have a tear in my eye for the Tigers opening goals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:56^U
Couldn't give a rat's behind about this game, but by GOD do I want Radelaide to win it next week for Phil #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:56^U
@jrhennessy For the 100th time, I would like to register my disappointment that the Cats traded Caddy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:57^U
Are they seriously not tagging Martin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:57^U
Yowza. That's the 2nd goal for the might Tigers within 2 minutes. #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges (yes, I'm a @sydneyswans supporter - go Tiges)^2017-09-23 16:17:57^U
Huge start from the Tiges - Dusty relentless driving them forward #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:59^U
Whoa 🐯 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:59^U
I firmly believe Richmond can still finish 9th. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:17:59^U
Great start!! Keep it up boys! 🐯 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:02^U
Fuck Dustin Martin is too good #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:02^U
Holy HELL two goals to the Tiges in under two mins. Wish my nanna were here to see this #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:04^U
As a club, Richmond has embraced this occasion all week and now the players are too. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:04^U
Cannot deal with another blowout final. This has already been the dullest finals series ever.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:06^U
Long way to go but Dusty - WOW @Richmond_FC #AFLTigersGiants @7NewsSydney^2017-09-23 16:18:07^U
They can hurt you from here #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:08^U
Terrible start by the tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:08^U
Martin really needs to start getting his hands on the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:08^U
What a start #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:18:09^U
This is this the most electric crowd I have ever seen at a final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:10^U
This better not turn into yet another #AFLFinals whitewash #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:10^U
Another ad the ad breaks have had more airplay  than the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:11^U
I've never heard anything like this before in my life!! I go for Carlton, this shouldn't be exciting me.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:11^U
That start makes up for the 100s of losers I've backed today. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:12^U
2 quick goals to start. The crowd is deafening, and that's just in my lounge room. Son (11) is going nuts. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals 😁^2017-09-23 16:18:13^U
went outside to bring in the shopping and have already missed 2 goals! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:18:14^U
#AFLTigersGiants 1:05 elapsed time, 2 goals up. Couldn't have even dreamt this start.^2017-09-23 16:18:14^U
I'm going deaf from the Tiger roar from 30kms away. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:15^U

2 goals in 70 seconds It's all over #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:16^U
Heath Shaw should retire after that piss weak effort on the wing before Tigers 2nd goal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:17^U
2 ALREADY #AFLTigersGiants  #Tigers^2017-09-23 16:18:17^U
This one going the way of the others already. Could be all but over in 10 minutes. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:19^U
Not even a minute in and I’m starting to doubt my stamina here... #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/dvfjspMFGW^2017-09-23 16:18:20^U
3 years later, it appears Cotchin finally won the toss in a final. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals^2017-09-23 16:18:21^U
WTF Giants? It won't take much for me to start hating you again. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:22^U
My goodness. 65 seconds is all it took for Tigers to go two goals in front? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:24^U

The MCG is genuinely about to fall over. The noise is incredible! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:18:45^U
For the 100th time, I’d like to register my disappointment that the Cats traded away Caddy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:46^U
Tigers are out of the blocks fast ... long way to go. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:48^U

What a cracking start! Dusty touches the footy twice, @Richmond_FC have 2 majors on the board within 1 min. Wow. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:18:53^U
I hope:  1) It’s a close game; and  2) Commentators remember there are two teams playing today.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:18:54^U
This is B O N K E R S #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:18:54^U

Hey @sportsbetcomau what are the odds on Dustin being most common new boys name in 2018? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:19:36^U
I only wear orange and black to clean the bathroom. Giants also getting cleaned up early.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:19:37^U

Is this the biggest attendance by supporters from a single club in AFL history? #mustbe #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:33^U
The Giants supporters are electric. Quite deafening. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:33^U

Yo @Channel7 please calm down with the ads, we have a game to watch #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:43^U

How on earth is that bit 50m? He's nearly bumped him into the grand final sprint #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:51^U
Grimes by name, grimey by nature. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:52^U
Got the stuffing knocked out of him (deliberately I might add) and still threaded it. Great job kid 👍🏻 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:53^U
How sportsmanlike are the Tigers fans? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:53^U
That's exactly what Dangerfield should have done last night. GWS get a quick one back. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:20:53^U
Wowser, the GWS cheer squad have had to bring musical instruments to try and crank up their volume  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:53^U
This is what I hate about teams who are new... they have barely any fans and it's not enjoyable. imo #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:56^U
Im a hater of that hit on the unprotected player marking the ball - late or not. Ordinary Grimes. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:20:57^U

Kicks two goals comes off the ground. Unbelievable! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:41^U
Great bouncing idiots. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:41^U
Himmelberg's kicked two goals in two minutes and he has to run to the bench. Stupid team rules lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:43^U
Nerves of steel by Himmelberg. He wasn't rattled in the slightest. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:45^U

Whatever station Brian Taylor is commenting is probably copping a rant about not taking off the in-form forward #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:49^U
REALLY WANT GWS TO WIN.   IT WOULD JUST. BE. FUNNY. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:51^U
Poised on the big stage, good effort from Himmelberg. Good game so far. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:50^U
Richmond haven't made a Grand Final since 1982 so we're probably going to have a 50 goal shootout to remind us. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:51^U
Come on @GWSGIANTS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:22:51^U

Hope Deledio kicks the winner in a tight finish 😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:25:03^U
what was it @DennisCometti7 94 words when 10 would do? Ling #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:25:07^U
Bad enough listening to Ling's whiny, yelling voice for Cats games, seems like no respite #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:25:09^U
MCG crowd balance reminds me of Cricket World Cup AUS v NZL and Martins 1st goal like McMilllian bowled in 1st over #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:25:10^U

Well aren't we lucky, Cameron Ling commentating both Prelims 🙄 At least he won't be super biased this game #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:25:49^U

Cotchin hit more trouble than Sloane with MRP. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:26:55^A
I’m in Louisville, Kentucky 🇺🇸 right now and even I am barracking for tigers to  pull thru. That’s saying something.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:26:55^U
Dylan Shiel is in strife. Not sure if it's shoulder or face. Looks shaken #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:26:55^A
Cotchin in trouble for that? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:26:56^A
At least it looks like this one will be a decent #AFLFinals contest #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:26:56^U

Not seen such a 1 sided Prelim crowd since 2014 NRL final when Souths played Rooters. 52,589 Souths to 3 Rooters #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:27:06^U

Should be a good contest between two teams @Adelaide_FC have beaten by an average of 6 goals in every meeting this year. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:27:16^U

@triplemfooty 1st contact from Cotchin was to the head!...misses round 1 next year? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:27:25^A
Went the man not the ball...head high contact. Cotchin sitting out next week ??? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:27:28^A

Love em or hate em, you can't deny the atmosphere Richmond fans bring to a match is electric. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:27:42^U
#AFLTigersGiants that was a bit in the head, wasn't it. How come commentators haven't said a thing?^2017-09-23 16:27:44^A
Cotch will be sweating on the MRP after that hit! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:27:50^A
#AFLTigersGiants think cotchin got sheil in the head  #weeks^2017-09-23 16:27:51^A

The anarchist in me is starting to cheer loudly for GWS.   (Note to the Govt: actually not an anarchist). #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:28:02^U
Cotchin will be saved by the fact they’ll lose, but if required the Makey Uppy League will invoke the Good Bloke GF rule. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:28:04^A
Richmond supporters will be spent by quarter time if they keep up this booing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:28:05^U
Cotchin could be in trouble for that - really careless hit #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:28:07^A
Check out that crowd at the MCG! As my finals team, hope the Tigers prevail 🐯 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:28:10^U

#AFLTigersGiants woo hoo Giants https://t.co/HYvHRXWLcf^2017-09-23 16:29:17^U
Considering track record, that should be weeks for Cotchin.  But it's the AFL, so he'll get off with a pat on the back #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:29:24^A
Dunno what they're talking about, crowd at mine (pictured) is clearly in favour of the @GWSGIANTS. Carn boys #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:29:26^U
Already the Tigers aggression is costing them some cheap free kicks. Could be costly.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:29:29^A
We live in a world where Basil Zempilas and Luke Darcy commentate a prelim final. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:29:30^U

Cotchin will get a week for that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:37^A
Cotchin has to miss the GF now, but the corrupt @afl won't let that happen #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:30:37^A
Dylan Shiel has been unreal since that shoulder scare. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:38^A
Richmond look slow   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:38^U
Fuck up Basil you literal spastic! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:30:38^U
Tigers can't afford to kick behinds. Not with this@m#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:39^U
GWS in control now .. Tigers need to respond #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals    #afltigersgiants^2017-09-23 16:30:40^U
I think this looks bad for Richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:42^U
Was wondering what the silence of 90k crowd sounded like 😂😂  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:42^U
Lol Basil trying to get Cotchin suspended. That's even worse than their trying to get Sloane suspended last night. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:43^A
Tigers are done, im calling it early! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:43^U
Fuck on basil you complete fuckwit  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:43^A
What a goal! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:43^U
Meanwhile, at the MCG, Tigers fans be like #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/yIa4aO3o3G^2017-09-23 16:30:43^U
#AFLTigersGiants shutup Bazil^2017-09-23 16:30:44^A
Giants way on top now 😬 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:49^U
Cotchin gone. No GF for the sniper! Head High all day long! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:49^A
Cotchin will be looked at for high contact against Shiel. He was going for the balk so should be all clear #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:49^A
It's almost like Melbournians don't like GWS. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:50^U
What’s the psychology behind taking off players as soon as they’ve scored a goal? AFL clubs been doing it for years #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:53^U
Fuck up Baz #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:30:54^A
Just Wow!!! @MCG #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/3nun9gMeiX^2017-09-23 16:30:53^U
Oh Fuck off Basil #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:55^A
If richmond win cotchin gets off, they lose he gets a week #AFLTigersGiants #integrity^2017-09-23 16:30:57^A
Good to see the best mid in the game dominating...   Dustin Martin is playing too.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:30:58^U
STATS | 🐯 started with a bang but @GWSGIANTS are coming.  Giants: +8 cont possessions +13 uncont possessions +4 i50s  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:30:59^U
Tigers swarm on the contest. Get it out &amp; you have the numbers on the outside. Giants all over it. Well and truly in this #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:00^U
Loool, it’s happening. Cotch playing his last game for the season! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:00^A
I don't mind darce and Richo, but fuck basil  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:01^A
Shiel has been everywhere since that hit #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:02^A
#AFLTigersGiants Tigers were doing the hunting in the opening 2 minutes...now #GWS on the hunt and looking dangerous...well done.^2017-09-23 16:31:03^U
If Cotchin's in trouble, Sloane should be too. Won't happen, not in gf week. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:04^A
Basil Zempilas trying to create drama where there isn't any #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:05^A
As an @Adelaide_FC supporter I don't know who I want to win this game #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:09^U
I may only be watching from the telly, but the Giants fans are making a fair bit of noise. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:10^U
Cotchin likely to miss the first week of next season #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:12^A
Is Cotchin in trouble for that hit? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:12^A
#AFLTigersGiants if MRP are consistent Cotchin is gone. If.......if......^2017-09-23 16:31:13^A
Basil making something of nothing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:14^A
Absolutely nothing in that Cotchin / Shiel one. Going for footy, incidental, Shiel fine. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:17^A
Umpires over umpiring this game. Dont want to be influenced by the crowd and are going too far the other way #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:18^U
Great they're over-umpiring 😔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:19^U
Dustin Martin is overrated... #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/o6uN0HoYtx^2017-09-23 16:31:20^U
One of the best reasons to go to the footy is that you don’t get to hear the vocal stylings of ex-cat ling #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:25^U
When @GWSGIANTS get their outside running game going &amp; move the ball fast &amp; clean they're a very dangerous team! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:26^U
#AFLTigersGiants ch7 dont seem to care when giants score but tigers score its over the top excitement totally for tigers joke^2017-09-23 16:31:29^U
I am so stressed I just want this to be over #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:30^U
Dear @7AFL please don't spend the entire match speculating on that bump. Thanks, everyone watching this game. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:30^U
Seems like all the Tigers booing is given GWS momentum #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:31^U
I really dont think @Richmond_FC expected this from @GWSGIANTS. They have bitten back pretty hard. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:31:36^U
Hang on somebody hasn't read the script, GWS seem a fair bit more skilful than the Tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:39^U
lol  Fucken commentators already mounting the defense for Cotchin.  He'll be fine because Shiel will play out the game.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:40^A

Basil, that's a horrible comment. No way at all is there any report on Cochin. Have you even seen finals football? @7AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:47^A
Giants look to be handling the crowd fine. They've got some big game players. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:48^U
#AFLTigersGiants Suddenly Zemplas is a state prosecutor.^2017-09-23 16:31:49^A
Gee whiz this @GWSGIANTS side are exciting to watch.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:55^U
So glad that the Giants have settled and don't seem too awed by the crowd, the 1st 2 minutes were worrying #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:55^U
Deledio tanking for his old side. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:31:56^U
That counter from GWS was sliiiiick.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:00^U
Unrelated: wtf is happening? #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/KpF4vgDCwI^2017-09-23 16:32:02^U
@Richmond_FC to busy trying to be "hard". Play the footy first.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:04^U
Folks are dumb where he comes from. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/qT4tTiKR3B^2017-09-23 16:32:04^U

How is Fanta not sponsoring the Orange Tsunami? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:26^U
#AFLTigersGiants could Basil want to stir it up anymore? He wants trouble for Cotchin and his horrid commentary as the soundtrack. Loser.^2017-09-23 16:32:29^A
It’s already so special #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:32^U

Heath Shaw is having a stinker   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:48^U
Blinding pace early. Richmond explosive start, Giants respond very quickly. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:48^U
Basil zemplis is a muppet. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:49^A
Heath Shaw sleeper agent for @Richmond_FC #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:58^U
Not sure how many kicks he's had, but Riewoldt has already posted at least 2 hard ball free kick requests. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:32:59^U
Harrison Himmelberg has the best name in the entire AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:32:59^U
anything could happen, gws or tigers, vs adel, @AFL    anything could happen    #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:01^U

Commentary vomit material #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:23^U
Statistically, in this finals series, the team with the least amount of man-buns wins #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:25^U

Did I just hear Lingy. Thought his season would be over following his loss. Should be getting ready for Mad Monday #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:28^U
Cotchin is so elite #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:33:29^U
Not a big fan of GWS, but in this atmosphere can't help but go for them! I like the underdog. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:32^U
Jeewiz might have a game here!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:32^U
LOOK AT HIM KICK! LOOK AT HIM...MISS! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:33^U
Heath Shaw a total liability early. Shocking. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:34^U
Look at that kick!!!!!!!.... 1 point  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:38^U
Cotchin must be suspended otherwise the MRP is a joke forever #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:38^A
The @Channel7 commentary team. Big cotchin dickriders! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:44^A
Cool change has hit Melbourne now 17Deg  #AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:33:46^U
Hah. When the bounce goes the wrong way, and it's not your team, it's actually pretty funny. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:47^U
THAT. WOULD. HAVE. BEEN. A. GOAL. COTCH 😳🙌  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:49^U
In a normal world, Cotchin would get suspended for that. If Tigers win, will the AFL fall to their knees or do their job? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:51^A
Is Basil fucking Zempilas really the best that @Channel7 can do?? My ears are bleeding! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:33:58^A

Basil ur ruining the game. Mute him #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:05^A
Cotchin knew that Shiel has the Juddy shoulders and lined him up. Nothing in it tho. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:07^A
Toby Greene went with one hand then when he easily could have used two....looked VERY soft.... #footsteps #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:07^U
Greene just shat himself in the middle of the G in a prelim in front of 90k #aflfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:09^U

Umpires are from NSW obviously!  #AFLTigersGiants #Richmond #AFL^2017-09-23 16:34:31^U
Didn't want any Sydney team in the GF, but now, I would like to see all those tiger fans go home crying Go Giants  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:32^U

Really really really really looking forward to seeing Wilson in a Freo jumper #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:40^U
Putting it on there, I'd prefer to play Richmond next week #weflyasone #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:40^U
Tigers are going to have to stop these nervous fumbles if they want to win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:45^U
Fumbling. Fumbling everywhere #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:46^U
#AFLTigersGiants Great to see so many Tiger fans come in from the slums of Melbourne for the big game. So exciting for these peasants.^2017-09-23 16:34:48^U
How was that a free kick to the human hanger.. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:49^U
I know it's early and the score is only a couple points the diff, but it feels like it's gonna be a blowout to me #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:34:51^U
Q1 | Is @tcotchin9 in trouble for this hit on Dylan Shiel?  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/sFY3mhNbyx^2017-09-23 16:34:54^A
Where are the Giants fans sitting?! Barely seen #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:01^U
Wilson might be better suited for West Coast rather than Freo after that effort #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:06^U
Rance wasn’t looking at the footy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:09^U

Richmond have no chance of winning if their only gameplan is to kick it and hope for the best every time they get the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:19^U
I can smell the BO of the Tiger Army from here. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:21^U
I can’t watch. It’s too much. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:22^U

Anyone got a crowd figure??? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:33^U
90000 tigers fans think it’s a free kick every time their team go near the ball. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:35^U
Why do seven put ling on the cats game and Richo on the tigers game?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:39^U

#AFLTigersGiants Dream start from Tigers 2 goals in first 2 mins! Nice come back wth Giants kicking next 3!!!^2017-09-23 16:35:54^U
AFL just gave Cotchin a free Brownlow...no way they'd have the balls to suspend him for that.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:56^A
Im sorry but I'd rather see Richmond lose next week, it'd hurt more! 😅 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:56^U

That is one feral looking crowd. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:35:59^U

"They'll have a look at it." Could Trent Cotchin be in MRP trouble? https://t.co/aYTViRJNGS #AFLTigersGiants… https://t.co/JhpSgu0L2b^2017-09-23 16:36:11^A
I think there are GWS players with man buns than GWS fans at the ground #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:11^U
I've got a bad feeling about this #AFLTigersGiants #YellowAndBlack^2017-09-23 16:36:14^U
Richo commentating like he used to play for one of these teams... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:22^U
tigers kick a behind and there was more enthusiasm for that then giants goals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:26^U
This is far to stressful I don't even want to watch. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:27^U
GWS are switched on #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:28^U

May as well start engraving "Adelaide" on the premiership cup. Can't see either of these teams betting them. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:35^U
It's also time to acknowledge that apart from the smother on Riewoldt in 2010, Heath Shaw has been a liability in finals. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:36^U
2 early goals to the Tigers but the heat is on and the Tigers can't handle it at the moment! We are in for a close one #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:42^U
Stevie J playing like an old ruckman, looking for the handball off with every touch. Sooo slow. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:43^U
Surely @7AFL could have given BT or Bruce a 2nd game instead of using the over excitable Darcy. At least it's not Hamish. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:36:44^U
GWS getting on top through uncontested possessions. Plenty of run and willingness to take the game on #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:36:44^U

I doubt this game will do my frontal lobe's titanium clip any good #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:05^U
C'mon GWS, don't let the Termites back in it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:08^U
North Melbourne are quietly weeping in a corner somewhere. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:15^U
Unselfish that by Richmond. Nobody wanted to take the shot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:15^U
TBH, thinking of calling Draw #2 now, just so I look smart if it happens... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:18^U
Lobb heard footsteps!!! #AFLTigersGiants #meowwwww^2017-09-23 16:42:18^U
Rory Lobb owes the Giants one... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:18^U
Rory Lobb, awful. And we all saw it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:20^U
AFL have too much at stake for Richmond to lose. Go Giants! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:42:21^U
I'm sweATING go tiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:23^U
Now a shocker from Lobb hands the Tiges another... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:23^U
Caddy wanted no part of that set shot. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:24^U
HOW UNSELFISH IS DUSTY THOUGH 😍 @Richmond_FC #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:28^U
Dusty! What a team player. So unselfish! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:28^U
Tiges seem to have the necessary mongrel right now #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:28^U
Tigers over using the footy. Might cost them. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:29^U
Your goal Rory Lobb #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:30^U
Thats why I love Dusty! So unselfish! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFINALS🐯🐯🐯  They are back now!^2017-09-23 16:42:30^U
Did Lobb hear the potter patter of tiger paws? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:30^U
Lobb absolutely shit himself #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:31^U
Put the bloody tricks away, Tiges. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:31^U
Couple of squib efforts Lobb and Greene #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:39^U
Heath Shaw is Richmond's best player. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:40^U
Geez....they tried to Richmondy that! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:41^U
UNSELFISH Dusty! Team player there @Richmond_FC  27-21 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:43^U
Richmomd playing like they are 15 goals ahead, short pass from Martin, head all over the top. Bunch of flogs. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:45^U
Richmond looking shaky!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:45^U
Beautiful play although they nearly fingered it, Listen to that crowd! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:46^U
Lobb was trash there, cost a goal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:48^U
Hated the showboating handball from Caddy there - no need for it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:51^U
Richmond game plan, get the ball to Dusty,  3 out of 4 goals from his work #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:52^U
Scotty: The Giants need someone to play between Dusty and the space in front of him inside forward 50. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:42:53^U
#AFLTigersGiants got to take those Rory Lobb, it will cost you in big games^2017-09-23 16:42:57^U
Castagna close to best on ground so far. Glad we stuck with him. Dusty so unselfish. #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 16:42:58^U
Heath Shaw is a liability #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:42:58^U
#AFLTigersGiants goal - risky but got there Castagnia^2017-09-23 16:42:59^U
Dusty's pass 🚀 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:00^U
Oh! You gotta love a rowdy pub! Go Tigers! @youngandjackson #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:01^U
Dusty, unselfish #AFLTigersGiants Well done bringing his team mates into the game.^2017-09-23 16:43:02^U
Dusty not wanting the responsibility? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:04^U
Lobb should check his undies after that effort #squib #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:05^U
Lobb just had a @jackdarling27 moment! #footsteps #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:07^U
Dusty, Dusty, Dusty! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:08^U
Too fucking good George 👊🏼🐯 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:43:10^U
Rory Lobbe may not wanna see that footage again. Cost his side. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:11^U
Richmond player has the ball &amp; ump calls holding the ball against gws #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/E7DbUdrE3m^2017-09-23 16:43:13^U
The roar for a Tigers goal, out of this world. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:43:15^U
@DustinMartin4 you are a star 🌟 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:16^U
Josh Kelly's shimmy is the cure for cancer.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:20^U
Melbourne took Scully/Trengrove over this guy 😂😂😂😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:21^U
Rory Lobb heard footsteps and cost the Giants a goal. Weak effort from a big man. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:22^U
I miss Dennis ☹️ #AFLFinals @7AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:23^U
#AFLTigersGiants two goals from 2 dodgy free kicks.  AFL/WWE don't won't ADL GWS final.^2017-09-23 16:43:23^U
Shouldn't be passing from 35 out ever #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:24^U
Heath Shaw should do something inspirational soon. Like smother the footy off Riewoldt's boot in the goal square. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:25^U
I really like the speed of Richmond. Not sure anyone can keep up with that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:30^U
No, no, no. If you mark 12m out you kick the goal. Got away with it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:31^U
#AFLTigersGiants isn't as boring as yesterdays #AFLCrowsCats since both teams got quick access to the game #GoGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:32^U
I didn't see this coming but here I am cheering for GWS... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:34^U
"Free to air networks are losing money &amp; ratings" "Check out our hot new creative show where people do bombs into a pool" #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:37^U
Just hoping all @EssendonFC players are watching this. The standard. The passion. Peak footy. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:37^U
Not a very convincing first quarter for Tigers #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:43:39^U
"Rance is a genius?" You don't have to be smart to make plays like that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:40^U
#AFLTigersGiants tigers not playing well. A couple of gifts from the umps and from the giants have kept it close^2017-09-23 16:43:40^U
Rory Lobb looks a bit of a liability early. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals^2017-09-23 16:43:44^U
Dropped marks by Shaw Lobb and Greene have been costly, all sitters too #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:49^U
Great team awareness from Dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:52^U
This game is going to be a cracker. Open, free flowing football.   #THESHOUTER #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:53^U
I feel like I'm betraying my family and childhood not watching #AFLTigersGiants but tough titties writing about soccer comes first.^2017-09-23 16:43:54^U
I believe that Dustin Martin is a talented Australian Rules Footballer #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:43:55^U
Player of the quarter has to be Castagna #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:01^U
It's Crouching (ex) Tiger Hidden Giant so far for Deledio...  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/cQWhtrivMB^2017-09-23 16:44:01^U
Huge 1st term from Tomlinson, covering plenty of ground #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:04^U
Is it possible the ball never moves faster than when its bouncing OFF Dustin Martin? #hardsurfaces #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:04^U
#AFLTigersGiants Tigers filthy and protected by VFL umpires.^2017-09-23 16:44:05^U
Ripping game thus far. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:08^U
Dustin Martin is pretty good at football. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/kvdNWUBo3O^2017-09-23 16:44:10^U
Do it for Jack Dyer! Do it for Richo! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:14^U
Loving this Spring Equinox Prelim Final.  Players  look like formidable marigolds. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:15^U
Beers and finals footy #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/x2ZSdYFFlz^2017-09-23 16:44:17^U
I am liking this game. Tigers are going to have to ace their tactics to win, home crowd or not #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:19^U
More tiresome: people booing Quade Cooper or Tom Scully? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:19^U
@DustinMartin4 is a god among boys out there today, what a hero! #AFLTigersGiants @AFL #AFL #WhatAGod^2017-09-23 16:44:22^U
They keep running behind, they need to run in front - that's their problem. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:27^U
LOBBBB won't want to see that again 👐🏉 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:44:36^U

Would it be better if Richmond lose..  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:39^U
A competitive final! What a lovely surprise #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:44^U
Dusty touches the ball. Richmond score 30 seconds later. *Pan to Dusty, the creator* #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:45^U
#AFLTigersGiants  How long before this tracker device pings players for running over 15m?^2017-09-23 16:44:53^U
It’s been a fast and ferocious start at the MCG! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/YkdCYuSIJw^2017-09-23 16:44:55^U
Taranto looks clean and composed for a 1st year player. Kid will be a gun #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:44:55^U
#AFLTigersGiants This unselfish Richmond is one of the big differences this year #gotiges^2017-09-23 16:44:56^U
Thank you Giants and Tigers this is just what I wanted so far. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:45:03^U
Yeah theres no fees in industry super, so those horrific ads are free for members? #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/5BinWyu7j8^2017-09-23 16:45:04^U
#AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals let's hope the umpiring improves - so far it's been 💩^2017-09-23 16:45:05^U
Careful tiges. Just wait til Smith, Greene &amp; Scully start having impacts #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:18^U
Houli Dooly...oh Basil, you're too much #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:19^U

Bloody umpires keep Richmond in the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:20^U
Umpires have read the script so far #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:26^U
Kelly has actually been pretty poor so far but the commentators are happy to suck him off though #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:29^U
#AFLTigersGiants come on Giants^2017-09-23 16:45:30^U
Give Josh Kelly the brownlow  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:30^U
Umpires have been great for the Tiges. Fuck me sideways... #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:45:35^U
Can someone pls remind the commentators that there’s still a game to be played?! Tigers aren’t in the GF automatically. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:35^U
Shut the fuck up Ling!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:37^U
Can someone put a muzzle on Basil? @7AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:49^U
#AFLTigersGiants Tigers drop ball in every tackle never called. Filthy cheats^2017-09-23 16:45:49^U
Good to see umps aren't going to react to screaming Tiger fans.... NOT!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:51^U
#AFLTigersGiants hey Lingy - turn the volume down on your voice, actually just shut up.^2017-09-23 16:45:53^U
Seriously umpires! CAN U CALL BALL EVERY TIME NOT JUST TO HELP OUT THE TIGERS OK. ABSOLUTE DISGRACE, SHOCKING UMPIRING #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:55^U
Great game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:58^U
@afl Hey Gil If the @GWSGIANTS win are you going to use AFL funds to hire @wswanderersfc fans to fly over for a piss up? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:45:58^U

The pressure of this contest really exposes the average players running around 🙄 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:46:02^U
Best final so far since Port v Eagles. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:46:04^U
Caddy pushed that GWS player way harder than Rioli got pushed #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:46:05^U
Finally a good game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:46:05^U
Go GWS! First time ever saying that 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:46:05^U
If GWS had any fans they'd be filthy at the umpiring so far #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:46:11^U

There's about three free kicks on that last play. Where's the hold? Where's the high call? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:18^U
Giants look good here #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:19^U

Can we please have a Cameron Ling mute option on all TV's, my god!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:31^U
You're a key forward. Go back and kick a goal Patton #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:47:32^U
Farrrk tigers, lucky GWS are as hopeless as you guys 😉😉 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:32^U

Paton wins the Levi Casboult's award #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:33^U
Now Patton didn't want it. Step up boys! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:34^U
Hey Levi Casboult, does Jonathan Patton remind you of anyone? ;) #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:34^U
Shame on the afl umpires. Afl engineering the game to avoid embarrassment of two interstate teams in grand final.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:35^U
Stiff. Should be a countdown clock #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:35^U

Got a game here #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:36^U
Ohhh you would not want that not to come back and haunt you @GWSGIANTS 🙈 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:36^U
It’s TIGHT at the MCG - Tigers by a goal at 1/4 time. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/KPk5vmCUsO^2017-09-23 16:47:37^U
Wonder whether that handball mistake will come back to bite the Giants later on… #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:47:38^U
Key forwards are paid to kick from 30 not handball. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:38^U
God I love Stevie J #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:39^U
A long overdue good final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:39^U
Now that's an opening quarter of finals footy! Tense, even contest. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:40^U
Living up to the hype 🔥🔥🔥 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:41^U
Oops! Massive mistake in front of the tiger 🐯 faithful - won't let forget that one #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:42^U
#AFLTigersGiants unselfish football is selfish football. About time it's bitten a team on the arse!^2017-09-23 16:47:43^U
You just get the impression GWS will regret that 20 mins of non-scoring dominance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:43^U
Patton you fucking idiot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:44^U
Key forwards who don't want to go back and kick big set shots! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:46^U

Is just me or do the umps want the tigers to win ? Loads of calls going there way #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:47^U
Fair to say Tigers are mastering the Klopp gegenpressing at this point ...Vinnie #AFLTigersGiants #wehaveanameforit^2017-09-23 16:47:47^U
#AFLTigersGiants shocking lack of messaging from .@GWSGIANTS coaching staff for that to happen on siren^2017-09-23 16:47:47^U
Patton lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:48^U

Your camera work is terrible @Channel7! Get your shit together. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:50^U
Does anyone know when the last finals series was that no Rioli played in? #aflfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:49^U
Ohhhhh, brutal for Patton there... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:50^U
Leon Cameron played for both Bulldogs and Tigers..... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:50^U
Good work Jon Patton #slowclap #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:51^U
Sucked shit Stevie J 😂 #GoTigers #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:47:52^U
Wow, that hurts. Just kick the goal. Poor 10 minutes from the Giants. Brilliant quarter of footy  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:52^U
What a brain melt by Patton. Haha. Playing on after the siren! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:47:53^U
One down 3 to go. #FearTheRoar #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:53^U

Has to be Richmond!#AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/8eG2wGZMGt^2017-09-23 16:47:54^U
#AFLTigersGiants Filthy shirt front by Tigers not called. This is so pathetic VFL trying to engineer  Vic finalist.^2017-09-23 16:47:54^U
Cheers Patton #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:54^U
Sensational opening term from Cotchin #leadingfromthefront #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:47:55^U
I appreciate unselfish play etc, but why doesn't Patton back himself from there? Time aside. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:55^U
Poor bastard!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:56^U
For a bloke who has been to 15 clubs Josh Caddy has a lot to say #lookatme #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:57^U
Patton that’s crazy!  Go back take your kick. Where was the runner or players telling him to stop. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:58^U
There's moments in games that could be one still have nightmares about nick Reiwoldt on replay gf #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:58^U
Unforgivable #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/KwlpJN1uHC^2017-09-23 16:47:58^U
Suck shit, greene after a cheapy and your ff on big money wont shoot from 25 😂😂#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:58^U
It’s clear that all of the tigers fans sittin near me know none of the rules and never seen a game before. Delusional. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:59^U
You’re a fucking forward. Go back and have a shot. And the umpiring needs to remove itself from Richmond’s arse. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:47:59^U
LOL @ Patton playing on just as the siren was about to go. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:00^U
Patton with his own Courtenay Dempsey moment #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:02^U
Nothing worse than having draw at any quarter and see a bloke play on with 1 second to go and fuck your bet up #filthy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:02^U
Paton you absolute knob #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals^2017-09-23 16:48:02^U
Anybody have video of the umpire falling over?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:04^U
Toby Greene is mentally shot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:05^U
Counterplay, Windspelle, Stampede, Menari &amp; Petetion. Now I have to listen to C. Ling again. #caulfield  #AFLTigersGiants #ivegotaheadache^2017-09-23 16:48:06^U
Poor from Giants runners there should have been telling players time left to avoid that #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:07^U
Not usually a fan, but Cotchin is channelling Lenny Hayes today. Huge workrate. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:07^U
Get off the field Razor! @AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:08^U
#RazorRay as the emergency umpire trying to get involved...he loves the big stage. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:11^U
I don't believe it! He played on?! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:11^U
Why Patton why?????? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:11^U
Well that first quarter seemed to be more about commentators and their egos than the game itself #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:11^U
What a fumble 🙈 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:12^U
Patton with a brain fart. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:12^U
Oh dear General !!!!!  Good first quarter - loving the contest &amp; both teams having a crack #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:13^U
@GWSGIANTS may be well outnumbered in the stands but they holding their own on field #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/qNEwjqaOIH^2017-09-23 16:48:13^U
I can’t lip read, but pretty sure Dimma just said: Fucking Bachar Houli. So relatable #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #gotiges^2017-09-23 16:48:14^U
Umps being influenced by the crowd #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:14^U
Feel like Giants settled way better than they could've hoped. Look dangerous every time they go forward #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:15^U
Inside 50? Have a shot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:17^U
A little less Tom Hawkins needed there from JPat. He should’ve owned that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:18^U
Smartarse work calling for the ball when you should be backing your man to go back and slot it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:19^U

What. Was. Jon. Patton. Thinking. Big key forward. 40m out virtually directly in front any he handballs off? Wow #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:19^U
I really hope Stevie J absolutely smashes someone from the tigers. A retired players duty. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:19^U
How to lose a final. Well done Patton #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:20^U
Richmond has the biggest wankers as fans. Years of Richmond being losers has obviously rubbed off on the fans #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:20^U
You won't see many better quarters of footy than they one!! #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:21^U
Love the passion #stevej plays with. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:22^U
#AFLTigersGiants umpires have given the tigers the lead.  So many free kicks GWS should have got.^2017-09-23 16:48:24^U
Haha! Patton u pinhead.  Bit loud for messages or just a pinhead....... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:25^U
Ive seen enough to know that neither of these teams are fit to share the ground with last nights Adelaide side. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:27^U
Razor not umpiring but still gets his head on TV it's a rare skill #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:28^U
Jon Patton with a brain fart at quarter time. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:28^U
Now this is a final! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:30^U
I reckon Stevie J would have put Caddy back in his box at the Cats a few times and doing it again at Qtr time #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:30^U
There's a defining moment in this match right there #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:32^U
Will never NEVER understand why a bloke paid to kick goals(a forward) would pass off to pocket when in range............ #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:33^U
lucky tiges, don't look switched on at all #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:33^U
I'm already willing to proclaim this the match of the round. QT GWS 21 Richmond 27. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #NeverSurrender^2017-09-23 16:48:36^U
All Richmond fans right now... (Probs Giants fans as well...)   #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/9KPbrGKKwQ^2017-09-23 16:48:36^U
Did Stevie J just tell Razor Ray to fuck off? 😂😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:36^U
Wtf. Just turned on TV and missed first qtr of #AFLTigersGiants - I thought it wasn't on until 5! https://t.co/CTtTKJsNuS^2017-09-23 16:48:36^U
No idea why Patton played on there. He's a key forward - go back and kick the goal. Don't hand it off at that distance. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:39^U
Omg did that just happen #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/YPsQ6JmyWw^2017-09-23 16:48:40^U
Lmao shit Patton #AFLTigersGiants .Dustin Martin is the most unselfish player in the game alongside Eddie betts^2017-09-23 16:48:40^U
I can't even imagine that roar of the G, oh my! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals   Wow  👌🏼🤙^2017-09-23 16:48:43^U
@AFL @7AFL can you please send someone to my place to explain all the betting to my 2 kids. Thanks in advance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:44^U
The last final before the big dance is delivering, two deserving teams! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:45^U
That handball on the siren reminds of the time I tried to use an expired Groupon #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:46^U
Under estimated the skill at Parramatta's @riversidebrew . Glad I popped by for takeaways before the game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:46^U
D'oh! Patton, who loves a long kick for goal, chooses THAT moment to be unselfish. If a runner only warned him...#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:47^U
The moment where the runner should be out there advising players the siren is about to go. Patten should've known also.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:48^U
Cracking start. Footy the winner so far #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:49^U
Patton just did a Hawkins. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:49^U
Great qtr of footy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:50^U
Was it just me or did that siren go slightly late #AFLTigersGiants  #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:50^U
Of course Toby Greene's song is Bliss n Eso #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:50^U
Poor error Jon Patton giving up a 35m shot on Goal with a handball on the siren   #AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:50^U
Horrible luck for Patton, but hes been good in tbe first. Could be a big difference.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:52^U
Shouldn't Patton have known how little time was left? Usually the runner gets that message around. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:48:55^U
Stupid by Patton. Not unlucky, stupid. Gotta have some sort of a clue. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:55^U
Yes, it will be looked at.  #mrplotto #aflfinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/4QZ7627a0p^2017-09-23 16:48:56^U
Dumb from Patton but he needed someone telling him how long to go. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:57^U
With his record, even a fine will trigger a one-game ban for the Richmond skipper. https://t.co/VfmWG0GhL5 #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:48:59^U
Wow! Jonathan Patton actually IS thick as pig shit. I thought he just looked that dumb. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:01^U
Yeh I'm on the bandwagon. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/u6est8uaCV^2017-09-23 16:49:02^U
That Paton cockup could prove costly at the end of this match. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:49:04^U
How highly paid elite AFL players refuse to take ownership of very gettable set shots never ceases to amaze me. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:05^U
#AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants the tigs are up by 6pts but ch7 think its 66pts my god the ch7 comms is bias #nationalcomp^2017-09-23 16:49:06^U
Unfortunate move from Patton at the end of the quarter there.... Ouch. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:07^U
Back when the @Richmond_FC was cool. And hot. 🔥😍🔥 #bencousins #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/XSdV4Y0xuD^2017-09-23 16:49:10^U
Shocking game awareness by Patton, he has to know its late in the quarter, go back, ice the quarter, &amp; have a shot. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:14^U
Unselfish play by #dusty. Great game so far. This has the feel of last kick of the game to win. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:14^U
You are an oxygen thief josh caddy. Worst footballer in the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:16^U
GREAT opening quarter. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:16^U
Richmond's Richmond act out-Richmonded by Patton. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:18^U
what a dumbass why would you play on 😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:19^U
What are you doing Patton? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:20^U
Patton. What were you thinking 🤦🏻 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:49:22^U
Not sure the Giants would be that disappointed with their position #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:23^U
#AFLTigersGiants Burn their prayer mats then bury them, GO GIANTS^2017-09-23 16:49:25^U
Early call but I think we’ve got them. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:26^U
Amateurish coverage by @7AFL @TomBrowne7 @Stevo7AFL cutting away while the game continues. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:26^U
Key forwards not taking the responsibility to kick goals 🙄 It’s what you’re paid to do FFS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:26^U
Josh Caddy, you're a nerd. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:27^U

Jonathon Patton you are a beautiful kick just back yourself! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 16:49:31^U
Well Adelaide won’t have to game plan for Cotchin, he can enjoy watching the Grand Final from the sidelines #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:35^A
It's on like Donkey Kong...go Tigers! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:37^U
I’m guessing umps have re-read the script in the last five minutes #NoFreesGWS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:37^U

What happened to patton when he played on &amp; the siren went is the sort of thing that's happened to us for the last 30 yrs #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:40^U
Gee, you wouldn't want to lose by less than a kick after that..... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:40^U
Most stressful bandwagon ever #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:40^U
The #afl is actually playing cheering over the loud speakers when GWS get a goal. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:41^U
Patton you're paid to kick goals. U mark it 35m out directly in front &amp; u dish it off...🤦‍♂️ Go back &amp; fcking kick the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:49:43^U
Ugh...@Richmond_FC  fans...I do love this game though. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/yRYANX8Pmk^2017-09-23 16:49:43^U

#AFLTigersGiants, woulda thought if u mark the ball 30 out near an end of a quarter u go back &amp; kick for goal^2017-09-23 16:50:03^U
Little whoopsy by Patton. Great first quarter #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:50:04^U
Crazy that Patton opts not to take a shot 30m out. Never give it off under any circumstances #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:50:05^U

#AFLTigersGiants Richmond head hunting might come back to bite them. Heath Shaw was terrible that quarter, heard footsteps.^2017-09-23 16:50:10^U
Turns out the only thing more artificial than the GWS football club is their support. Pretty sure it's coming from the PA #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:50:14^U
Wonder if teams have rules about handballing from set shots deep into time on  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:50:15^U

Go back and fucking drop punt it you clown. This turning the body shit is a joke. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:22^U
LISTEN: @Richmond_FC lead by 6 points at the first change. All the 1st Qtr highlights of #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/ejo1aJfXeK^2017-09-23 16:55:25^U
No wonder nobody wants to take a set shot. That was horrid from Castagna. Stevie J does it because Stevie J can do it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:27^U
Just kick it straight young man. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:29^U
Geez if you're going to go with a snap 30m out on slight angle you need to kick it  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:29^U
dustin fucking martin 💛🖤 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:32^U

There's another, how can you hear a hush ??? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:51^U
Tiger gets tackled, releases ball from one hand, play on. Makes sense. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:55:52^U
@FOXFOOTY @Robbo_heraldsun #AFLTigersGiants can't believe the umpires can wear yellow. Surely causes confusion at the game?^2017-09-23 16:55:56^U
Good grief the commentators sycophantic dribble around Alex Rance is sickening #AFLTigersGiants @7^2017-09-23 16:56:01^U
How many decibels when Castagna missed from 15m out? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:06^U
I wanna but real estate from these umpires #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:08^U
The thing that will kill GWS is their lack of tackling. Too many wait for the ball to be won, not willing to lay a tackle. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:12^U
Another poor option from de Boer, had a simple HB to Stevie J running inside 50, costly #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:13^U
So Richmond are allowed to try and break tackles but when they get caught and no crowd noise no free! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:15^U
Finally a close finals game!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:17^U
Has Castagna not heard of a drop punt? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:18^U
"Front on contact"? That was called a spoil when I grew up. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:20^U
Patton did not want the boos at after the quarter time siren... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:26^U
The umps showing how desperate the AFL are for a Victorian team to make the Grand Final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:36^U
How can you be a professional AFL player and not have the ability to kick a drop punt from 20 out? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:41^U
This could be Costanza's Charlie Cameron game. Having a blinder, needs to kick em, though. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:45^U
@Sam_gray46 is still the best #46 in the comp.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:45^U
Exactly how far are the Tigers running without bouncing the ball hmm 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:47^U
Umpires are definitely on Tigers' side. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:47^U
The roar meter is our new favourite thing.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:48^U
That kick was awful.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:49^U

Front on contact...with the ball.  That is not a free.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:54^U
Castagna is just a poor mans Fantasia. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:56:55^U

The evenness of this Comp just shows Richmond apart from Martin &amp; Rance are nothing more then good local footballers  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 16:57:50^U
#AFLTigersGiants Casual AFL viewers but boy do the commentators have a fetish for crowd announcements. Something the NRL..generally avoids.^2017-09-23 16:57:50^U

Apparently Tom Scully is a good runner #commentators #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:00^U
Even though the digital radio is behind, it's still much better than the tv commentary! @3AWisfootball 👍🏼 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:03^U
The music/fake crowd noise when GWS kick a goal is a disgrace. #turnitoff #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:03^U
#AFLTigersGiants first decent contest all finals series^2017-09-23 17:02:05^U
#AFLTigersGiants had to be a kick Williams, just get it forward^2017-09-23 17:02:07^U
GWS just need to give the easy first handball, Ward then Williams trying to do too much #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:07^U

Crowd noise through stadium speakers for @GWSGIANTS. What crap @mcg @afl #AFLTigersGiants #GOTIGES^2017-09-23 17:02:29^U
Would like to point out that we currently have a Prelim Final that is commentated by Baz, Darce, Richo and Lingy.  Why?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:31^U
@DanielAndrewsMP If GWS win please cancel the public holiday #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:02:31^U

Do the umps know that there's 2 sides!? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:03:52^U
I was watching at home, but had to  watch it at the pub. I was making too much noise that I thought I’d get complaints #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:03:53^U

Good game so far as it’s close but skill level needs to pick up a fair bit  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:08^U
You never want your ball to hit the stick. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:09^U
Fuck me... Either Stevie J is wearing a gurnsey that is 2 sizes too small.... Or he has been carb loading.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:10^U
Umpires trying their best to keep the fairy tale alive #AFLTigersGiants #putthewhistleaway^2017-09-23 17:04:12^U
Not a lot of confidence with set shots so far... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:14^U
Stevie J looks absolutely cooked, if GWS make it to next week, can't see him playing #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:15^U

How was that not holding the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:16^U
@AFLTradeWhisper Only positive is the close score. Otherwise just turnovers, mistakes &amp; awful umpiring #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:18^U
You can't be serious umps. Ridiculous performance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:21^U
Josh Kelly celebrated too soon #lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:21^U
GWS regrets playing Steve J surely #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:04:23^U
Thanks for the umpiring update @7afl. Perhaps the umps might even get a kick for Richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:25^U
Martin on Shaw is a terrible mismatch!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:25^U
Richmond are playing with fire if they keep messing around with the footy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:26^U
9 freekicks in a row to tigers! Wtf #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:27^U
Richmond seem to be getting a lot of free kicks that aren’t really there #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:27^U
Shit. Shiel gone. Which could mean Cotchin is gone #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:32^A
Every now and then AFL delivers a game like this and reminds me why it's the best sporting code in Oz #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:04:41^U
Can't believe how much time and space Kelly is being afforded #bizarre #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:04:41^U

BA reporting Dylan Shiel is done for the day with concussion...what does this mean for Cotchin at the MRP? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:05:03^A
Think Shiel is done, looks teary on the bench. Concussion? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:05:03^A
Josh Kelly is simply beautiful to watch 🤗 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:05:09^U

A Bruce-free commentary is a goose-free commentary; thanks @Channel7 but let's keep it up for the GF coverage  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:05:12^U

Hey @Richmond_FC the aim is to kick the ball *between* the sticks. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:05:23^U

Cue a week of Trent Cotchin at the tribunal and the AFL media going mad.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:07:18^A
Good to see the Richmond idiots booing as a Giants player gets his head ripped off. 10 free kick in a row is not enough. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:07:19^U

No way to escape it now. Cotchin will be suspended. No way for the AFL to let him off and not look like massive hypocrites. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:07:27^A

Looks like Dylan Shiel is done for the day #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:08:51^A
I think the commentary team have finally realised Shiel got hit in the head? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:08:51^A
Bye bye Cotchin. No Grand Final either way. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:08:54^A
If Shiel is concussed, Cotchin gets a week. The rule is stupid, but they have to adjudicate by it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:08:57^A

Lingy it's not his shoulder #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:16^A
Following up on the last tweet, Shiel out for the game, if concussion, Cotchin must be suspended #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:18^A
Richmond had an EXCELLENT first two minutes of this game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:18^U
Will the giant eat the tigers? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:18^U
Ling has finally caught on that it's not a shoulder injury to Shiel. Honestly how does this guy have a job? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:18^A
Enough speculation - it was unfortunate but Cotchin is fine #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:20^A
Can Ling fuck off with this Cotchin suspension crap #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:20^A
Dylan Shiel gets shoulder injury/concussion, and the commentators are feeling sorry for Trent Cochin?? Fuck. Off. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:20^A
Richo: Jack Graham has still only had 2 shots for 2 goals. Pretty sure he's now had 3 shots. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:21^U

If Rich think the crowd/umps going to get them the win, think again. GWS could be 4+ goals up. Cleaner + more composed. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:09:27^U

Callan Ward = Lenny Hayes #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:38^U
Good to see Channel 7 with up to date info on Shiel. Lingy running w/ subluxation of shoulder like he’s a qualified physio! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:39^A
For mine Giants look fitter, faster &amp; more clinical. Tiges look like they're suffering the effects of a long season. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:39^U
Kath Day-Knight has the right idea #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/61ijnOr6cl^2017-09-23 17:10:40^U
Riewoldt.. Lazy disposals.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:42^U
GWS have clearly been the better team. Haven't made the most of it. Don't usually get away with that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:43^U
Case gets worse for Cotch.  Shiel done for game with concussion. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:10:45^A
Dylan Shiel (Concussion Test) - Done for the day  Trent Cotchin on 2 Fines, 1 more fine is auto suspension  #AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:10:45^A

Dustyyy 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾 #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:54^U
The sooner Cameron Ling goes back to being the paddlepop lion &amp; gets off the TV, the better. #nutsack #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:54^U
Basil just said "Look at Dusty inject himself" #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:10:59^U
Wait Richmond actually got a free kick? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/AEPXQTx4wa^2017-09-23 17:10:59^U
Anyone else that bump in the back would have been pinged.... #NotDusty  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:00^U
Commentary: he's putting on a jacket, mustnt be a shoulder injury, probs a concudsion.  Diagnosis cos he put on a jacket. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:04^A
.Dusty you're a star  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/hAg9yKbxtb^2017-09-23 17:11:04^U
"Trent Cotchin is untouchable" Gillon McLachlan to AFL Tribunal  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:08^A
Cotchin in NO trouble for contact. Went low, hard, eyes on ball and won it. Everything players are taught to do #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:09^A
Someone needs to knock Dusty out.  Miss a GF but at least you help the Giants get there. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:09^U
Jeez Cameron Ling is unbearable to listen to.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:10^U
INJURY UPDATE | Dylan Shiel is done for the day 🤕  Does that spell bad news for Trent Cotchin?  #AFLTigersGiants… https://t.co/lIr6FbMr0n^2017-09-23 17:11:11^A
No pressure on the umpires if GWS get four goals up #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:13^U
just bc he is small doesn't mean trent cotchin isn't a dirty player. regardless of the result he won't be playing next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:13^A
If it's concussion Cotchin is zero chance to play next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:16^A
Giant sound not for Tigers after all #AFLTigersGiants  🎶🎺🎷📯🎶👌❤^2017-09-23 17:11:18^U
#AFLTigersGiants tigers with some shocking kicking.^2017-09-23 17:11:23^U
Time to bring on Richo  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:24^U
Gerard Whateley on Cotchin hit on Dylan Shiel "I don't see how that is not a reportable incident" #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:11:29^A
#AFLTigersGiants Dusty on show at the G^2017-09-23 17:11:31^U
Cameron Ling is destroying any modicum of respect I had for him today. Do your job properly. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:31^U
Sorry Cotchin, rules are rules and the match committee set that standard this year 🤷🏽‍♂️#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:32^A
If we win without Shiel I will be very very very impressed #AFLFinal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:33^A
#AFLTigersGiants up your game tiges!!!^2017-09-23 17:11:35^U
Dylan Shiel rubbed out for the match and the commentators are showing their concern for Cotchin. This is fucking backwards #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:36^A
Townsend's missing? we're fucked. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:39^U
Geez if Cotchin doesn't go for Shiels concussion then I call conspiracy #AFLTigersGiants (if the Tiges win through!)^2017-09-23 17:11:40^A
Anyway. Stop talking about possible suspension as the game is an age from being over. Thx #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:42^A
These behinds tho from the Tigers #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/v8xUOUnskM^2017-09-23 17:11:42^U
Dusty has to come into midfield. Not involved enough #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:43^U
i thought Lingy is supposed to do special comments not state the fucking obvious  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:44^U
Ffs Ling you are just the boundary rider#shutthefuckup #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:47^U
#AFLTigersGiants Dusty on a mission there 👊^2017-09-23 17:11:50^U
Tiger crowd a little quiet.#AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:11:50^U
Can Ricoh do solo special commentary the rest of the game? Pretty please? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:51^U
@P90Walsh That should have been their pregame instructions. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:52^U
Gee, Cotchin in strife.. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:56^A
Tell you what, if I got concussion during a Prelim final, I wouldn't be sitting the rest of the game out #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:57^A
Why are the commentators on Richmonds side. Damn annoying. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:11:57^U
Luke Darcy is voting yes to marry Dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:00^U
What does Jason Cloke, Anthony Rocca, Phil Carmen &amp; Trent Cotchin have in common? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:03^U
Dustin has 'won more awards than Meryl Streep'  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:06^U
Dusty! Says fuck this! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:07^U
Nervous hush over the crowd at the moment #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:07^U
If the Giants win this I will be cheering loudly for Adelaide next week😡😡😡 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:07^U
That contested footy from Dusty Martin is everything you need to know about why he's the best game changer in the comp. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:07^U
@Richmond_FC Get Dusty on the bloody ground I don't want to see him sit down! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:09^U
If you close your eyes it sounds like Skilled Stadium #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:12^U
#AFLTigersGiants Umpires turning a blind eye to filth of Tigers. #AFLCheats #AFLmoneyb4sport^2017-09-23 17:12:13^U
If Giants are ahead at half time surely it has to be half price tolls on the M4. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:13^U
Make helmets compulsory to save the legitimate bump @tcotchin9 @7AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:14^A
Whenever Dusty's not onscreen, all the other characters should be asking "Where's Dusty"? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:16^U
#AFLTigersGiants is Lingy always this annoying?^2017-09-23 17:12:16^U
You can have the free kicks Richmond and GWS will have the scoreboard. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:16^U
Take me back to 00's Channel 10 commentary 😍 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:20^U
Get ur hands off ur dick every time u say DUSTY  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/Fvmo1FupdU^2017-09-23 17:12:22^U
Disadvantageous 50m penalties are my favourite free kicks. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:12:23^U
GWS have 50 more possessions than us, 50, fuck me dead, get the fucking ball Richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:31^U
Free kick count please #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:32^U
Rod Marsh reference, one for the gen X'ers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:35^U
Shiel is out? That should be a serious concern for any Giants people #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:35^A

Can Cameron Ling stfp with his high pitched loud volume captain obvious comments - anyone else being driven spare?#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:40^U
Nathan Wilson (Shoulder) - Remains on the ground   #AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:12:40^U
If I was a Tiger fan, Nankervis would make me very nervous #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:41^U
Cotchin got himself a token Brownlow, now he may get a Bob Murphy Premiership Medallion™ too.   #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:12:42^A
Basil finally utters a good line.  I'll pay the Meryl Streep comparison. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:44^U

Wilson's kicking 💜💜💜 ⚓️ #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:46^U
That was 50 but Grimes earlier wasn't??? #InconsistentAFLUmpires  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:49^U
After everything Jacob Townsend gave to the Giants, it's disappointing to hear the boos from the GWS fan at the G #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:12:50^U
😵 Nathan Wilson: Sore in his left shoulder after spoiling Edwards in Q2 #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/CqpE4kyKGP^2017-09-23 17:12:54^U

Beautiful silence at the G right now. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:04^U
Cotchin working his arse off to try get his side into a GF that he will be suspended for #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:05^A
True, despite her storied footy career, Meryl Streep never won the AFLPA MVP #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:06^U

Is Trent Cotchin in trouble for his contact with Dylan Shiel?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:21^A
Zac Williams having a mare with footy in hand, butchering it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:23^U

Stop chopping and changing the view @7AFL making it hard to watch!!!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:25^U
These umpires are doing everything they can to get richmond up. Embarrassing for the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:25^U
#AFLTigersGiants  If the Giants beat the Tigers this avo, they have to change the club name to Elephants, Mammoths or even Dinosaurs. 🤗^2017-09-23 17:13:26^U
I LOVE THE DON'T ARGUE #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:29^U
That was insane from Dusty. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:30^U
If Tigers win and Cotchin misses GF for that, footy has gone soft. Sloane on Danger was worse last night &amp; nothing said #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:31^A
Are the Channel 7 commentary team scared of Dustin Martins Dad or something? God they rant and rave over anything he does #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:32^U
This Dustin Martin guy isn't too bad! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:13:33^U

Dusty is a class above everyone on the ground right now. That was superb. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:14:05^U
Ling consistently referring to Dusty as "breent", he's making Richo look like an oxford english lecturer #AFLTigersGiants  #twat^2017-09-23 17:14:05^U
Really can't see a way that Cotchin doesn't get at least a fine for that incident, meaning he'll get a week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:14:07^A
Lingy, he hit him in th head not the shoulder mate #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:14:07^A

#AFLTigersGiants goal! Well done Rioli 35-36^2017-09-23 17:14:59^U
Would much prefer to watch #Decison17 #NZvotes on @ABCNews24 but husband is a Tigers fan 😠 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:00^U
Not the only brainfade Phil Davis has had by the looks of his hairstyle ..... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:01^U
It no wonder Dimma let's Dan Rioli reside at his place!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:02^U
It wouldn't be a final without some Rioli magic #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:02^U
most stressful moment of my life  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:03^U
We had to listen to him last night and again today. Cameron Ling shut the fuck up. #AFLTigersGiants #7sport^2017-09-23 17:15:06^U
How do we get Lingy sacked?? Drug testing? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:06^U
Rioli summed that up beautifully #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:15:06^U
Phil Davis an impostor #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:07^U
No family enjoys September like the Riolis #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:07^U
Stevie J looks too slow for this game  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:08^U
Mick: Rioli simply does all the right things....when he has the ball, things happen. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:15:08^U
Nice kick, Rioli. #soundsfamiliaralright #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:08^U

Phil 🥔 Davis #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:10^U
Daniel Rioli much needed Goal for the Tigers, Giants wasting chances   #AFL #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:15:10^U
If GWS win, there’s no way Stevie J gets a game next week. He looks putrid #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:11^U
If your name is Rioli, then you are made for the #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:12^U
If anyone wants a decent broadcast of this game, do yourself a favour and put AFL Nation on. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:12^U
@realAJDooley I'm just amazed that they can talk with his dick in their collective mouth #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:13^U
GWS need Lids and Toby to LIFT. Ward doing it himself at the moment. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:13^U
Phil Davis - Take the dive, act hurt, get indignant #aflfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:13^U
Tiges really doing well from both teams' junk disposals. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:15^U
Nothing more dangerous than a Rioli in September #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:18^U
I really hope Richmond win tonight. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:18^U
Hate that Woolies ad #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:19^U
Cotchin such a wanna-be tough guy deserves a week #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:19^A
I am just so happy that the Giants have ignored the embarrassing, partisan, small down nonsense of Richmond and Melb media t#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:28^U
Theres one of these stories every year, wish it wasn't Shiel 💔 #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/rVH5Kmdcjy^2017-09-23 17:15:28^A
Who gives a shit about the roar  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:29^U

Time game!! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/ey3mvPwQ2e^2017-09-23 17:15:31^U
I miss Channel 10 AFL commentators. Bearable compared to this Channel 7 mob #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:35^U
Oh this is like watching #HillaryClinton getting fucked in the election by #trump 😂😂 #AFLTigersGiants #fuckTheTiges 🖕🏼^2017-09-23 17:15:36^U
Dusty Martin has a #Sherrin shaped brain. I mean that in a good way #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges^2017-09-23 17:15:36^U
Given their tragic last few decades, I'd really like to support the Tigers tonight. Then again, Dustin Martin's tattoos. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:43^U
Finally another close final... I want the 🐯to win but only if the dint win next week lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:45^U
Still anticipating Richmond bottling this in some hilarious way #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:46^U
The Rioli gene....the big-moment brilliance gene that all Riolis share. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:15:50^U
How many sprint efforts have these decibel readings made? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:01^U
Goodbye Cotchin. If they make the grand final no way can he escape a fine let alone a suspension. 3 strikes and you are out #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:01^A
@borgy017 hes got to kick those goals there vital, lost momentum 12 point turn arounds #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:03^U
CAT: if I teen would you catch me? ME: Wtf skeletons? #AFLTigersGiants CAT: jorts = BAE. ME: Wtf boners? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:04^U
@Channel7 can you stop showing replays and show the play!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:08^U
How have we ever watched a footy broadcast without constant updates from the decibel meter? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:10^U
Three cheers for Rioli #GOTIGES #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:15^U
Between the 'roar meter' and Cameron Ling, this game is hard to watch #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:15^U
Dusty stoppping and touching the ball in congestion could sum up his game awareness this year - in a class of his own #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:17^U
Why @Channel7, why? Cameron Ling commentating two finals is just torture.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:18^U
C7 are showing 🐯 goal replays with the crowd roar. Has never happen before   #pathetic  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:18^U
I'm heading off to #melbfringe soon but in the meantime, food and #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:20^U
Could the umpires just not blow the whistle for 5 minutes unless it's REALLY a free kick. It's a final, let it go. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:21^U
Struggling to see how Cotchin is in trouble. His only other option was to not got for the ball. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:23^A
Great disposals giants:  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/U9KLvlfGAJ^2017-09-23 17:16:27^U
The commentators are going to be referring to the decibels of the crowd a tedious amount of times. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:29^U
Geez Rioli has got a long leg for a little bloke #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:36^U

#AFLTigersGiants AFL cheating, trying to get a Melbourne team into the Grand Finals!^2017-09-23 17:16:42^U
What was Phil Davis thinking #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:43^U
The question for every #AFLTigersGiants fan – did the umpires eat enough? https://t.co/aRRomPT0PU^2017-09-23 17:16:47^U
Patton is playing as well as Hawkins did last night.. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:48^U
If a giants players touches a richmond player, it's a push in the back, if Richmond does it to GWS it's a fair challenge #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:52^U
Richmond are more a one man (Martin) team then think North (Carey) was in the 90s 🤣 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:16:56^U
Wow this ref is doing everything he can to keep GWS in this game.. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:16:58^U

So many man buns. A blight on the game. Never saw John Platten worry about his hair getting in his eyes!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:01^U

I reckon Ling would have been that annoying little kid that used run off &amp; dob for everything #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:28^U
Rory Lobb is where offensive moves go to die #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:30^U
Dylan Shiel yet to return to the field with what may be concussion.  Not good for Cotchin.  Also Shiel for that matter...  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:31^A
Forget Cotchin, it’s going to be a big call whether Shiel gets up for next week. Big decision for the Giants. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:32^A
#AFLTigersGiants note to @7AFL - we don't care about the decibel rating. Not unless the meter is being inserted into Ling.^2017-09-23 17:17:35^U

Lobb, Williams both fumbly and awful... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:17:58^U
The NRL should get the doctor on to explain injuries and what’s happening #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:18:05^U

One of the joys of watching this game with a typical Richmond fan is getting to know the players' names together #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:18:21^U
Richmond got lucky there #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:18:22^U

Easy free kicks today  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:06^U
WTF umpires #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:06^U
If Cotchin gets suspended/fined for that bump then the spirit of football is dead #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:08^A
Umpires doing all they can to get Richmond in the GF. Annoying #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:08^U

HELP ME. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:30^U
My blood pressure is soaring.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:31^U
#AFLTigersGiants another cheap call from the umps, 100% want the tigers to win this^2017-09-23 17:19:31^U
I need a volume lower than mute for this commentary team, JFC #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:19:31^U
Charity shot by dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:32^U
Hahahahaha Richmond 3 goals from frees the dusty kicks the point. Up yours umpire #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:32^U
#AFLTigersGiants the general having a shocker^2017-09-23 17:19:33^U
Even Richo not sure what that was for  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:33^U
Old mate - you need to kick straight like your mullet. #embarrassing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:34^U
Put the fucking whistle away #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:35^U
Oh fuck off you green maggots. Clearly these scumpires have got no balls and are scared of the ferals in the crowd. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:37^U
These umpires are a disgrace #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinal^2017-09-23 17:19:37^U
The over umpiring in this final series has been pathetic. Let finals go FFS!! #AFLTigersGIANTS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:37^U
Some of the Tigers set shots today have been very average. If they win today they better work like crazy on it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:37^U
Patton's field kicking is lazy/nervous #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:41^U
Tigers are choking in front of goal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:41^U
Umps getting closer to having a kick for Tiges #freekickrichmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:42^U
Williams followed by Lobb for worst on the ground  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:43^U
How about the Umps give it a rest with the Free kicks.... let them fucking play.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:44^U
Does anyone know what the free kick count is? Because it seems the umpires are in the Giants pocket at the moment #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:46^U
The dB might be high, but I can still hear you Basil and Ling. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:47^U
Am I the only one that things the Umps are doing well today? Like. I never say that. Ever. In any sport. Ever. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:47^U
Cunty Cotchin to miss the GF if they win. I’d like to see that #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:48^A
Let us watch how the commentators will spin that miss by Dusty as a champion move or how he meant it #overdusty  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:49^U
#AFLTigersGiants @MatthewLloyd18 you need to start a #grasstoss academy..these blokes have no idea^2017-09-23 17:19:50^U
My good m8 @flamingyarnos and I watching #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:50^U
I think @Adelaide_FC would be feeling pretty good watching this! Happy to be wrong #AFLTigersGiants #crowssuperiorskills #1980alongtime^2017-09-23 17:19:50^U
It’s the prelim we’ve been waiting for! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:55^U
And if GWS win then no Shiel. Win-win for the Crows. #AFLTigersGiants #Concussion^2017-09-23 17:19:55^A
Bullshit free kicks for tigers 🐯 I’m not a gws fan but someone seems to want the tigers to get up #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:56^U
If this is what either of these teams roll out next week, give adelaide the flag now. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:56^U
#AFLTigersGiants just saw Nick Mazwell on the field for Giants. I'm sold. LETS GO GIANTS!!!!^2017-09-23 17:19:57^U
Hey umps, put the whistle away on these soft frees. #notaboutyou #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:57^U
Good to see the umpires are being inconspicuous #AFLTigersGiants #afltigersgiants^2017-09-23 17:19:57^U
GWS big men having a bit of a Barry Crocker so far, Lobb and Patton with plenty of pooch screwing #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:19:59^U
Thanks Dusty, that's the game! You're a hoax! @GWSGIANTS #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:19:59^U
Cameron Ling: "really experienced umpire, nailed that call". Channel 7 doesn't even show the full replay. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:00^U
Fuck off Lingy, there is no need to yell the way you do... Just speak normally, mate #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:01^U
Either Dustin Martin is having a bad day, or his hero worship is severely misplaced 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:02^U

#Patton's head gets smaller by the week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:05^U
Cotchin missing round 1 is getting a lot of air time. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:08^A
Richmond doing much right - but their kicking at goal has been shocking. #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 17:20:11^U
Tiges... I hope you win but only matchwinner i can see at this point is Rioli.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:12^U
Hate to say it but I can't see Cotchin getting off for the hit on Shiel #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:13^A
@borgy017 defensively hes brilliant but fuck he needs to kick those goals. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:13^U
Seriously, Martain could walk past a contest and Luke Darcy would be "Incredible play by Dusty"  #AFLTigersGiants… https://t.co/HI31QrmwCe^2017-09-23 17:20:15^U
For fuck sake Basil, grow a uterus and have Dustin Martyn's baby already, then shut the fuck up. Annoying cunt #AFLTigersGiants #dick^2017-09-23 17:20:15^U
Put the whistle away...cheap free kicks being payed everywhere. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:20:17^U
#AFLTigersGiants umps are gonna break a finals record for most fk in a game^2017-09-23 17:20:17^U
Anyone else notice a fair bit of yelling into the mic? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:18^U
That was a rubbish decision, umpire. It's a good game. Don't ruin it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:20^U
40 free kicks for the whole #AFLCrowsCats game last night and so far there have been 29 in the #AFLTigersGiants #letitgo #ruiningthegame^2017-09-23 17:20:23^U
Umpires must have a clear directive,make sure Richmond hey thru. Crucifying GWS players while tigers get away with murder #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:25^U
We've got the close one. Approaching half time and Tigers lead by a point. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:25^U
Enjoy Mad Monday Cotchin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:26^A
Game is to big for dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:26^U
Not sure what's more questionable - the skill errors or the umpiring  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:27^U
Umpires: stop blowing the bloody whistle &amp; let the game happen! #AFLTigersGiants @AFL^2017-09-23 17:20:30^U
I’m just tweeting about it! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:31^U
I really don't see how either of these teams will beat the Crows next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:32^U
Umpires in the Tiger train here #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:20:33^U
If this is the best commentary that Ch7 can put up then they are starving big time #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:34^U
JT always got time for the fans 👊🏾❤️ #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:34^U
Richmond kicking has been abysmal. This is your job. All you have to do is kick the ball through the big posts. Not hard. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:36^U
#AFLTigersGiants Umpires are feeling envious/neglected, so it's their role to ruin a good game.^2017-09-23 17:20:37^U
#AFLTigersGiants this commentary from Channel7 is horrible.^2017-09-23 17:20:39^U
WTF Tigers??? Why can’t they score a goal from free kicks this quarter? #GoTiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:39^U
Another dropping the ball - why aren’t they being paid against Richmond?? Ridiculous  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:41^U
#AFLTigersGiants Anyone's  game^2017-09-23 17:20:44^U
How are those nerves Tigers fans? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:45^U
There are no doubts that the umpires and commentators are going for the tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:48^U
This is a ring a ding ding #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:49^U
How wasn't that a free for GWS? He literally dropped it &amp; didn't kick it!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:52^U
#AFLTigersGiants rioli didn't kick or handball it so shouldn't that have been incorrect disposal?^2017-09-23 17:20:53^U
Johnson and Deledio HAVE to be dropped if they make it through #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:54^U
Over umpiring from the muppets in green. Let the players play the game instead of paying soft free kicks. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:20:55^U
Adelaide players watching this game..  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/xoQgZ5FD04^2017-09-23 17:21:00^U
GWS will come out of this game with 3 injuries meanwhile Richmond will have 0 because you're not allowed to touch them #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:00^U
Lids looks so much better in Yellow &amp; Black #JustSaying #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:01^U
@triplemfooty A lot of eating their own going on in the crowd Tigers very very nervy  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:03^U
This is most bias commentary team I've ever head. It's actually horrible to listen to #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals^2017-09-23 17:21:03^U
Hey media! How about we stop talking about a potential Cotchin suspension &amp; focus on the game of footy? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges^2017-09-23 17:21:05^A
@DHughesy The commentators are ruining this. Wonder how much of the “Roar Meter” (groan) is from their own barracking? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:05^U
Brett Deledio offering nothing again. Why’s he in the team? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:08^U
Who is the Giants biggest passenger?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:09^U
MAXWELL CANNOT SPEND THAT MUCH TIME ON THE GROUND!!! Fix this AFl #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:10^U
.@7aflgameday camera work &amp; vision switching is less than impressive  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:10^U
#AFLTigersGiants rioli dropped ball but no free FFS umpires just making it up as they go along^2017-09-23 17:21:16^U
If Martin starts hitting targets with his disposals at some time in his career he will be unstoppable #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:16^U
People will be sayin' that was a handy point - ain't they all handy? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:17^U
Unfortunately I think Trent Cotchin has played his last game for the season regardless the result #AFLTigersGiants #suspension^2017-09-23 17:21:18^A
Must be the worst feeling ever, poor Dylan Shiel 😢 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:21:21^A
Where the fuck is Bruce Mcavaney??? Please put the national treasure on for the second half @Channel7 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:22^U
Why is everyone going on about Trent cotchin? Tigers need to win first before worrying about next week 🙄 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:24^A
You get a free kick and you get a free kick - free kicks for everyone!!!  you#AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/KXBA9R8tiq^2017-09-23 17:21:26^U
Channel Seven Sport @Channel7 should replace Basil Zempilas with Jason Bennett. Do the right thing next season producers. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:27^U
Finally lobb holds on to one #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:28^U
#AFLTigersGiants tigers in front of goal https://t.co/Tr3B9URyBF^2017-09-23 17:21:30^U
Deledio's been Richmond's best player of the last decade and he's been booed every time he's touched the ball. Righto #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:32^U
Shiel has concussion. The Sniper misses the GF. Sucked In. Karma for Lachie Neale punch. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:34^A
Heath Shaw out on the full. Drink! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:35^U
Terrible news for Shiel - Cotchin got his 'free hit' against Neale earlier this season imagine he'll get a week #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:38^A
Lobb is better than Mumford. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:40^U
nail biting stuff #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:41^U
Is Toby on the field? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:42^U
And we're in front at HT. Go you beautiful Tiges! #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/VLnZZ2gTm3^2017-09-23 17:21:42^U
1/2 time: @Richmond_FC 5.7 (37) lead @GWSGIANTS 5.6 (36). Looks like we've got a close one at the 'G #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:21:43^U
Richmond de-looks st delirious and those morons boo him #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:43^U
Channel 7 reported Shiel's concussion at 5:47, at least 18 minutes after other media suggested he failed conc test #amateur #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:45^A
#AFLTigersGiants @AFL @7AFL   Get Maxwell off the ground... he is coaching not delivering any message!^2017-09-23 17:21:46^U
HT: It's the Tigers by a hair, leading GWS 5.7 (37) to 5.6 (36). #AFLTigersGiants ScoreCentre https://t.co/ddiq0fXJlk^2017-09-23 17:21:47^U
Hearing both Lingy and Richo sook if the Tigers lose will be priceless #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:49^U
Disappointing to see so many empty seats in MCC area #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:50^U
Certainly more competitive contest today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:52^U
Would love to see how many mins Nick Maxwell has spent on ground. GPS about 2 blow up. Get on, give ur message - get off! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:52^U
#AFLTigersGiants Doesn't matter who you support a tight close game always gets the heart pumping!^2017-09-23 17:21:57^U
Shame on every Richmond supporter booing Brett Deledio. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:58^U
Rance with another Dive #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:59^U
What a game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:21:59^U
Is the Richmond booing of Lids just setting him up to kick the ultimate Richmondy winner?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:21:59^U
#AFLTigersGiants Does Patton make poor decisions often - his disposals under pressure today are dodgy to say the least.^2017-09-23 17:22:00^U
Neither of these teams stand a chance against Adelaide. Skills are just not there. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:04^U
This is the worst umpiring I have seen all year. Boarder line cheating. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:07^U
How pathetic that you boo a champion player of your club. #deledio #pathetic #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:07^U
Haha look at Razor Ray champing at the bit to get in the action #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:07^U
HT  Tigers: 5.7 (37) Giants: 5.6 (36)  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:08^U
Thanks Dusty, that's the game! You're a hoax! @GWSGIANTS @RichmondTigers1 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:09^U
This game needs more free kicks #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:10^U
Rance acting again.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:15^U
#AFLTigersGiants I can't get over the Tiger fans sooking every week over frees. A good team deals with it.^2017-09-23 17:22:16^U
Steve J is such a fucking dog #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:16^U
@sportsbetcomau And Dusty breaks one tackle and Luke 'total wanker' Darcy carries on for ten minutes #AFLTigersGiants @Channel7^2017-09-23 17:22:17^U
Trent Cotchin is going to get suspended for round one of next season. Oh well. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:18^A
Love your work Stevie Jay!#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:18^U
Rance loves a dive. Should play soccer #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:18^U
Don't touch Rance's beautiful face! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:18^U
Does everybody know there is a big crowd at the MCG so we have been told.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:19^U
Half time #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/ajiZ9UGG7Y^2017-09-23 17:22:19^U
Rance such a Nancy boy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:22^U
#AFLTigersGiants Dylan Sheil gone....so is Cotchin....^2017-09-23 17:22:22^A
Sell out pffft,there's only 94,000 at #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:22^U

Take a dive Rance you massive spud #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:23^U
Alex Rance is a soft cunt #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:23^U
Fucken Rance.  Worse than Lindsay Thomas for throwing his head back.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:24^U
Richo suggesting the booing from Richmond fans towards Deledio is all in good nature #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/XHhS0Wn6pP^2017-09-23 17:22:24^U
Another WTF moment from Stevie J  #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:25^U
Tight quarter #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:25^U
Look at Razor Ray at the end there. What a peanut he is. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:26^U
Wonder if Rance cops the diver tag like Davis did? Unlikely... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:28^U
I am not coping with this #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 17:22:28^U
2nd hit by Astbury def contributed to Shiel’s delayed concussion symptoms but agree Cotchin’s hit will be a fine at a min. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:31^A
Rance the actor.#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:31^U
Rance doing what Rance does when there's some contact #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:32^U
We have ourselves a game! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:33^U
Rance doing a Clayton lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:33^U
Thought this would be a hard fought game.  Who will join @Adelaide_FC next weekend. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:33^U
Rance is an all-time great in the overacting department #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:34^U
And the Academy Award goes to... #RanceThePrance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:37^U
Super first half. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:38^U
Lol Stevie J. Doing stupid shit #smartarse #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:38^U
Oh Stevie J my favourite liability #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:39^U
Nice accidental deliberate whack to the face of Rance by Stevie J #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:40^U
Seems like Dusty is rehearsing his #Brownlow speech on field. Clearly isn't focusing on kicking straight. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:41^U
Stevie Johnson you dickhead #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:41^U
Cannot believe Richmond are up #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:41^U
Stevie J just played his last game! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:42^U
Rance your acting is ridiculous. #logies #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:42^U
Jesus Christ do the @7Sport commentators wanna be anymore biased. There are two teams out there &amp; viewers around australia. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:43^U
Youre an embarrassment, Rance... go play soccer you fucking skirt.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:44^U
Rance really does have a glass jaw, doesn't he? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:44^U
The finals footy thing isn't half bad when the game isn't bloody over by half-time... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:45^U
Steve J you did something that is not necessary LOL #GoTigers #GoGiants #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:45^U
I've never seen a fucking emergency umpire on the field at the end of a qtr as fast as razor #lookatme #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:45^U
Bye bye Stevie J if GWS get through what a peanut brain #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:46^U
Still anyone game #AFLFinal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:47^U
Don't think Stevie J will be kicking a bag after 1/2 time this week #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:22:48^U
Fuck Stevie J and scatterbrain Shaw. Go tiges  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:48^U
I hate Stevie J so much. He's such a man baby. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:48^U
Is Sam Lane going to go into the Giants cheer squad too? The bias is ridiculous  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:49^U
A close finals game? I never thought I would ever see one again #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:49^U
Yeah that was an accident Stevie J  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/Q5gKUw1pSL^2017-09-23 17:22:49^U
Really enjoying this contest - nothing really separating them apart from GWS being down a player #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:52^U
Rance staging again #repeatoffender #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:53^U

I'm gonna need to see a bit more from Jack Riewoldt. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:54^U
As per usual MRP will find a way not to make a big call and Cotchin will play next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:54^A
Ffs Rance, go play for a Latin soccer club if you're going to try that crap #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:55^U
I hope Rance is okay. That 'hit' was huge...... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:22:56^U
#AFLTigersGiants Range is dead set the biggest stager in the league. Boo fkn hoo you sook^2017-09-23 17:22:57^U

haha, rance at it again with the dramatic oscar worthy performance  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:00^U
Weak as piss, Rance you pissant stager! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:01^U
This game is gonna give me a heart attack I just want my boys to win #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 17:23:01^U
Who is the Giants biggest passenger? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:01^U
I love how the emergency umps kit makes it look like they work at Darkzone or something #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:01^U
All Australian captain and sooking bitch Rance trying to milk it again. For such a 'star' he certainly has a glass jaw! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:02^U
@tcotchin9 surely has a worry on his hands after opting to bump &amp; knocking Shiel out of the rest of the game. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:02^A
Scoring is overrated. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:03^U
nothing worse then an over umpired game. let the boys play #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:23:03^U
Oooooh we're halfway there. Wooooah living on a prayer. #FearTheRoar #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:05^U
I love Stevie J today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:05^U
Rance acting again after a brush to the neck. AFL need to take action &amp; fine him some $$, it's pathetic!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:06^U
#AFLTigersGiants Alex Rance going for yet another #Academy award for acting or gold medal for diving #pathetic #sook #weakaspiss^2017-09-23 17:23:09^U
Cotchin to miss next week. That’s huge. Pencil Adelaide in for the 🏆 now if Tigers make it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:11^A

#AFLTigersGiants another oscar over acting award to Rance^2017-09-23 17:23:15^U
Tigers hanging on. GWS overusing the ball way too much. Typical GWS though #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:17^U
Still think GWS have weathered the storm. Tigers would have wanted to be further ahead. Giants seem cleaner with the ball. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:17^U
What's going through Steve Johnson's mind? Given Rance jab to face after HT siren. Rance OK but he's taking his chances #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:17^U
Maybe if the ball was a hotdog Steve J might actually know what to do with it #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:23:18^U
That was exhausting.   Not sure I can do another half.   #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:23:19^U
Tigers buy a point at half time - what a game! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/WoO6LilbKL^2017-09-23 17:23:18^U
Get into it @RazorRay_18 twice now at the break first in,  can't keep a good dog down. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:20^U
Stevie J you dirty mutt! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:20^U
#AFLTigersGiants Rance.. You're a poser. Surely there's room for you to cpt the All Aus Staging team..^2017-09-23 17:23:22^U
Stevie J vs Alex Rance is so dramatic. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:22^U
Oh boy. Stevie will get a week for that on the stroke of half time. Will be suspended if Giants make the big dance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:23^U
This is making me nervous! Go Tiges! 🐯  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:23^U
#AFLTigersGiants how soft is Rance, squealing like a girl^2017-09-23 17:23:24^U
Umps fucking this game up #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:23:25^U
Do y'all think Rance can recover from such a forceful blow? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:29^U
@AFL Nick Maxwell spends more time on the ground compared to some players. Time to do something about it. #onfieldcoach #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:29^U

Stevie J one week ? 🤔 #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:42^U
Rance such a dog. Siren gone, still acts to try get Stevie J in trouble. Only ramification is a report if umps fall for it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:43^U
Watching it again, i agree. Tucks the shoulder and leans in towards Shiel. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/hFhprys2ul^2017-09-23 17:23:43^A

Let's see how soft Gil and his @AFL MRP are by letting the serial sniper off. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:48^A
rance isn't even good don't @ me #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:49^U
The one saving grace for Richmond is Dylan Shiels being out for rest of the game. Otherwise they'd be toast imo #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:50^A
I want the Giants to win only so Richmond's misery continues. Does this make me evil?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:51^U
Well. At least we have a close final hey!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:51^U

It's a nailbiter !!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:53^U
One Smirnoff voddie per quarter. I’ll cry if GWS win and I’ll cry if they loose. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:54^U
It's a joke Shiel didn't even get a free kick for that high bump. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:23:56^A
Caption this photo. I'll start: "How many carryover points have I got?" #smug #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/nDMyDjMih2^2017-09-23 17:23:56^U
GWS have a number of passengers but the Tigers are still nervous #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:01^U
If Stevie J isn't suspended for at least a week for that, then the @AFL is even more corrupt....than a Liberal government. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:04^U
Not much separating the two sides at the ‘G! Who’s been the better side? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/LxCFFPBcR7^2017-09-23 17:24:04^U
Think I'll watch an old Tiges grand final during half time #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:05^U
#AFLTigersGiants Looks like this nay come down to the wire. Go GWS^2017-09-23 17:24:07^U
I knew the IQ of Richmond supporters were low, but booing Deledio pretty much sums up that lot.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:07^U
Great game of footy so far! Looking forward to the second half #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:08^U

Cotchin gone from GF if the Tigers make it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:13^A
You’d think Rance being a JW, he would’ve been taught to stand up for himself a bit better 😂😂. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:13^U
I'm not really sure which team wants to win this game.. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:17^U
There's a fair chance this game will go to the end. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:20^U
We've been the better team.  I feel sick.  That's all I've got to offer right now.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:21^U
That's technically a week for Stevie J #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:24:21^U
#AFLTigersGiants How come the Tigers get their own umps? Maybe that isn't the case and they just don't want boos from 95000 people?^2017-09-23 17:24:22^U
It's good to see a final that doesn't have a 50 point margin at half time. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:22^U
@Richmond_FC Fantastic that we are in front, christ if i know how, but we are, which is good. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:23^U
How do we know the concussion is from the Cotchin hit and not the one a few minutes later #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals @SamLandsberger^2017-09-23 17:24:24^A
Nicely poised at half-time. Shiel gone. Cotchin in serious trouble. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:24:25^A

You need to shut up idiots you can't get suspended for what Cotchin did nothing wrong was trying to win the footy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:29^A

This is one heck of a battle #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:34^U
This game is certainly living up to expectations. With 95 000 people giving out a 125 db roar, that'll hurt! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:24:41^U

Q: What do Geelong &amp; Trent Cotchin have in common?   A: Both will miss the Grand Final #AFLGiantsTigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:45^A
Anyone thinking Cotchin is in trouble remember the tribunal seemingly have diff rules come grand final time eg Barry Hall #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:46^A
Nick Maxwell may as well just ask for a kick he's been out there the entire game !!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:24:46^U

2 quarters from a possible GF. I do not know how to explain the nerves I am having in 140 characters. #gotiges  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:14^U
It'll be a matter of whether 2 or 3 Giants can lift or the Tigers can settle #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:15^U
A good close final that's what we want to see. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:15^U

How anyone can look at that and say it doesn't hit Shiel's head is ridiculous #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:25:20^A
Going to be tough for Giants being man down for next half.  Richmond in box seat....... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:22^U
@FOXFOOTY team also Cotchin dickriders! He is gone! Derm is right! #foxfooty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:23^A

Shiel a massive loss for GWS. Someone has to stop Martin or Tigers win  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:24^A

Half time. Now let's hear @7AFL commentators try to beat up a frenzy around a nothing bump to try &amp; justify their own jobs #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:28^A
@thefrontbar7 Richmond with a kick after the siren. @mattricho0 @Richmond_FC #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:29^U
Cotchin elected to bump. He braces for contact. Shiel had the ball. Gone. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:30^A
The Tiger hype is irritating. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:34^U
Cotchin is gone. Simple as that. Tucked, went for bump, rather than ball.#AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:25:34^A
Can there be a draw in a Prelim Final? Just asking ... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:34^U
Take a seat Cotchin. See ya in 2018 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:35^A
I don't know much about footy.   But I know that if you miss a set shot then you start directing traffic.   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:25:36^U

Nickelback? Can't be serious 😷🤢@7AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:06^U
Cotchin would trade in his Brownlow to play next week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:02^U
What is the % that Stevie J purposely clocked Rance on the siren? 1000%? 2000%? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:10^U
I miss Dennis Cometti so much  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:10^U

Spot on Derm! No way was Cotchin's first focus on the ball!! Hand wasn't even out to collect it! @FOXFootyLive #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:17^A
#AFLTigersGiants for once #Dermie is right. #Cotchin went the man, not the ball.^2017-09-23 17:26:18^A
Crap game so far. Can only hope second half is better.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:18^U

#AFLTigersGiants cotchin tucked his arm for the bump. Could have tackled him, chose to bump, hit the head = gone.^2017-09-23 17:26:24^U
Dermie trying to get someone suspended what a flog #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:24^U
Cotchin has to get a game. Grand final or not it's high contact.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:25^U
So the Shiel, incident didn't even warrant a free kick. Wow!  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:26:29^U
Shiel done for the day with concussion. Cotchin has to go for at least 1 now.   #THESHOUTER #AFLTigersGiants… https://t.co/Z9KCZOb9Ac^2017-09-23 17:26:31^A
I missed the first quarter, did Green kick anyone in the head yet? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:33^U
Cotchin is gone. If he isn't, the MRP is a fucking disgrace. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:33^A
Crows could start premiership celebrations now based on the standard of this game  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:36^U

Eddie right, Derm wrong. Cotchin can't be susp for protecting himself while attacking the ball. Contact incidental. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:50^A
I'm sure Tigers fans are just excited us neutrals are getting an exciting game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:26:52^U
#AFLTigersGiants Cotchin s a filthy pig. Should be out of the game.^2017-09-23 17:26:52^A

I don't think Cotchin should miss next week but the Giants will get up anyway. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:27:10^A
Jeez - u don't want to see someone miss a GF for that, but they've gone all year. Huge blow for GWS too :/  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:27:10^U

Is Rance aware this isn’t a soap opera? Not the time or place for that overacting 😁 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:27:29^U
Shut up Basil you dill. If Cotchin gets done for that I'm done. It's an accident, his sole intent was the ball.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:27:33^A

If Cotchin gets done for the hit on Shiel, it's against everything you're taught as kif when attacking the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:27:48^A

I’m far from an AFL expert but I see nothing wrong with that Cotchin incident, he just went in for the ball hard imo #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:28:18^A
Absolute twaddle spoken by Jon Ralph on @FOXFootyLive   Cotchin protecting himself going the ball.  Get your hand off it   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:28:22^A
In Eddie McGuire's court, everybody would get off. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:28:24^A

Richo needs to stop talking about 'intent' on the Cotchin hit. Still careless, still head-high, still concussed #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:28:26^A
I know Deledio is under the pump, but there's no way that should be even looked at. Eyes for the ball, contact accidental #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:28:27^U

Cotchin has ruined this game, Tigers only got back into it when Shiel went off. Deserves a week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:07^A
Victorians complain about NRL commentators being biased against Storm, try listening to Fox Footy / C7 commentators today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:07^U
Cotchin should not miss a match for that... but he should for the sum of his actions over the year. Sadly it may b a GF. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:12^A
How are Richo and Basil the two best commentators @7AFL can pull on a Saturday afternoon for a Preliminary Final? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:12^U

Tigers lose, Cotchin gets suspended, the win, carry on. It's how the AFL work. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:15^A
Sports stadiums are loud during professional sporting events. Mind. Blown. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:16^U
#AFLTigersGiants To all Tigers fans, please remember Beyond Blue is available after the game.  #nextyear^2017-09-23 17:30:17^U
This game will basically decide who loses the GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:18^U
Cotchin is on two fines. Any grading on this table will get him suspended. Goodbye. 👋 #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/5bAYr5MGVX^2017-09-23 17:30:19^A

#AFLTigersGiants Easy question with Cotchin is the head sacrosanct or not?  If yes, suspension, if no, he's fine. Pressured MRP if Tiges win^2017-09-23 17:30:27^A

Can't wait for all the footy talk over the next few days to be about "the bump" #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:30^U
2 strikes, now concussed a player with a head high hit. No way out of this one!   #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/c2OTVAHMNQ^2017-09-23 17:30:31^A

@FOXFOOTY #AFLTigersGiants  pull your head in Eddie. Sheil has his head over the ball. It's ok to bump him in the head is it?^2017-09-23 17:30:41^A
Tom Scully runs hard for the money, so hard for the money #AFLTigersGiants #TelstraTracker^2017-09-23 17:30:42^U
Things can change in a half, but the way they're playing I wouldn't expect either team to knock Adelaide off. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:42^U
Either result, this game is a win for Deledio #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:44^U
Shiel is arguably the Giants' best player. He's now out of the game because of Cotchin. There has to be consequences! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:53^A
Very evenly poised. Giants didn't make the most of their dominance in that 2nd quarter. Game on #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:30:56^U

At least if the tigers lose we can convert the stadium tears to energy and Victoria will be 100% renewable until 2027 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:07^U

Chose to bump, end of story. If Cotchin doesn't get suspended, he'll get a fine which will be 3rd one so a week anyway #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:11^U
No way Cotchin can miss a gf for that #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals^2017-09-23 17:31:15^U

If Barry Hall got off, Cotchin will too with a knighthood thrown in! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:28^U
#AFLTigersGiants Giants would be up by 5 goals if they weren't being robbed.^2017-09-23 17:31:31^U
Amused at Dermot arguing that Kotchin has a case to answer. This from one of the great onfield thugs of the 80s  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:33^U

If they out Cotchin, that means Sloan and Tex miss as well.  All pretty safe considering the Barry Hall ruling tbh. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:38^U
"Nah nah, dont worry about it" giants supporter-half time #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:44^U
@7AFL Richo no player intends to hit others in head.  But have duty of care. Cotchin has to be in strife.Head sacrosanct  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:46^U
GWS very clean; Richmond a bit fiddly, apart from Martin. If Tigers can clean up, they have a chance. Poor Cotchin, though #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:31:54^U
Crikey! Kinda glad I'm not watching it live, might be too stressful. Go Tigers! #afl #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/tE4Vw9F0PR^2017-09-23 17:31:55^U

@rosemarym66 #AFLTigersGiants ? it's only halftime hehe^2017-09-23 17:32:07^U
Surely no way Cotchin plays the granny after that even if they don't choke #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:08^U
as an unbiased onlooker I don't think cotchin should get rubbed out for that, but given his record its a possibility. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:09^U
Should never miss out on a grand final if Tigers make it, going hard at the footy in a prelim,If Fyfe I would be furious. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:09^U
@ABCAFL @abcgrandstand If that's the case, Sloan must go. Ran past the ball - forearm to the chin.  #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:11^U
#AFLTigersGiants  Stevie J will retire and to be replaced by Jessie J.  If Dustin Martin goes next season, Richmond will hire Ricky Martin.^2017-09-23 17:32:17^U

Cotch gets at least a fine. But I'm looking forward to seeing how the AFL weasels him out of it if the Tiges win #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:33^U
Whoever the Richmond kicking coach is should be fired #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:34^U
Let’s be honest, Cotchin went the man first then the ball. Got him in the head and he’s concussed. He’s gone. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:39^U
'You can't miss a GF/Origin for that' is the single most frustrating argument in #AFL and #NRL. Foul play is foul play. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:32:40^U

Given Cotchins history this year I would say he should be rubbed out, unfortunate it might mean missing the granny #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:14^U
@GWSGIANTS One team playing football, other team trying out for UFC. #NeverSurrender #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:18^U
Should have gone for the Neale hit, no Grand Final for Mr Cotchin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:18^U
As usual a great contest but a shit game.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:18^U
Great tough game so far, interesting second half ahead! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:19^U
Wouldn't mind seeing Deledio play out of the goal square in the second half. Can't get a kick at half back is concerning #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:20^U
Eddie commentating has Richmond already in grand final because it's home of VFL ...can't have a captain miss out on the GF 😡#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:23^U
I actually can't handle the thought of GWS playing in the granny next week. No no no. Cmon tiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:29^U
Cotchin won't play next week, regardless of who wins today. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:44^U
Trent Cotchin is gonna miss the granny either way 🤷‍♂️ #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:33:48^U

One of these teams will definitely win today 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:08^U
Can't separate these 2 teams. Which one will lose to Crows next week? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:09^U
Pretty sure Astbury got Shiel by accident 10 minutes after Cotch for memory.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:10^U
Pre-game - All Richmond. Half-Time - All Richmond   Fuck you @7AFL   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:13^U

Shiel has concussion, Cotchin innocent just going for the ball, shd be ok says Eddie Everywhere. Yeah, right, has to go #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:35^U
The idea of the game is to win the ball that's what he was attempting to do #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:41^U
Would be shattered for Cotchin if he missed the Grand Final, but just shows stupid punches have consequences #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:34:42^U
Oh Eddie McGuire on TV and has NOT said something sexist or racist. Is he ok? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:34:44^U

FWIW, I am pleasantly amazed that this game is as close as it is. A big improvement from the Giants from the Adelaide game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:35:27^U
Lets be honest folks, the winner of #AFLTigersGiants will get the snot beaten out of them by Adelaide in The Granny.^2017-09-23 17:35:29^U

Will channel 7 compare the noise (dB) at the MCG to a library when Richmond lose? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:37:14^U
Will there be an investigation into the Richmond player not running through the interchange gates in the first quarter  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:37:14^U

#AFLTigersGiants Channel 7 commentary is on loop: 1. Cotchin and Sheil 2. The noise #bringbackchannel10^2017-09-23 17:37:55^U
Now I want Tigers to lose for the sole reason of not having to hear anymore Cotchin MRP speculation. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:37:57^U
Ok we get. The MFP will be looking at the incident. The commentators can stop talking about it at EVERY opportunity  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:38:05^U
I am more worried about GWS being +50 in possessions and +35 or more in uncontested possessions. Ouch. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:38:08^U
Stop yelling at me Cameron #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:38:10^U

pretty sure neither of these teams has a shot against the crows but #AFLTigersGiants is fun as hell^2017-09-23 17:39:27^U
Did channel 7 speak to any Giants fans or did they stay completely biased towards Richmond? I switched to @FOXFOOTY #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:39:32^U
Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister during the last time Richmond played in a Grand Final.   #35YearsAgo    #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:39:36^U

I know the difference between Heinz Tomato Ketchup and regular ketchup, but I don't know what Ling brings to commentary #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:40:15^U

Is there another club playing today? I've only seen and heard of this Richmond club. #AFLFInals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:41:33^U
Does Basil think he is the judge and jury for the Cotchin hit on Shiel? #AFLTigersGiants #overthetop^2017-09-23 17:41:34^U

How the fuck is that holding the ball it was out of bounds before he finished tackling #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:03^U
Deledio and Johnson are embarrassing themselves #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:06^U
There are blokes dead set playing for free kicks here in a bloody Prelim! Both sides guilty. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:12^U

Choose to go 100% the ball turned his body to protect himself #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:20^U
How can it be illegal disposal over the boundary line??? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:48:20^U
Even the umpires are Cotchin knob riders. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:25^U
Umpires are destroying this game now. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:28^U
Cmon Tigers. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:48:30^U
When did they start paying free kicks over the boundary line? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:36^U
Umps are ruining this game as well #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:37^U

The umpire walked that goal down the field for the tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:52^U
FUCK YEAH. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:53^U
Rioli has been the difference for the Tiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:54^U
@3AWisfootball Don’t worry Cotchin, you will get a retrospective Premiership medallion years down the track. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:55^U
I've met Auskickers who handball better than Kamdyn McIntosh   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:56^U
I told you so....... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:57^U
Every team needs a rioli #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:57^U
Shut up about Cochin, Basil.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:58^U
Rioli is such a lil gun #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:48:58^U
Next person in football to be sacked .. McIntosh handball coach  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:00^U
Many annoying things about Basil. The worst: thinking the week's talking points are more important than the actual game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:01^U

#AFLTigersGiants goal another moment of brilliance from Rioli 44-37^2017-09-23 17:49:03^U
Geez I really hope the Tigers get up but if they do, I don't fancy their chances against the Crows...... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:03^U
Thanks @channel7 for providing ZERO atmosphere. I'd rather listen to 90,000 Richmond supporters than Basil Zemplis #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:05^U

Daniel Rioli keeping the Rioli name special in September #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:49:07^U
Umpires genuinely think this game is about them #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:10^U
GWS making the #afl gf will not have any impact on the code in Western Sydney. For the code's sake I hope Richmond win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:10^U
If your surname is Rioli, there's a fair to good chance you're a good footy player #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:12^U

#AFLTigersGiants totally disrespectful to AFL fans for AFL to direct umpires to make Richmond win.^2017-09-23 17:49:13^U
The RIOLI factor 🙌🏼🙌🏼 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:13^U
Insane kick from Rioli there. That hurts for the Giants. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:15^U
Rioli, like all his family.... big game player. #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants @Richmond_FC^2017-09-23 17:49:15^U
That holding the ball decision was out of bounds in every single other game of football in the history of the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:16^U
Good man ever!! Daniel #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:17^U
Can't half tell who the umpires want to win 😡 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:19^U
Second year in a row that we will see the premiership coach hand cup lifting duties to the missing skipper? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:19^U
Pffffft Typical! A Rioli standing up in a big game! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:20^U
Rioli is a machine. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:23^U
"HE'S GOT THE NAME AND HE'S GOT THE FINISH!" What does his name have to do with being able to kick a football? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:23^U
#Rioli unbelievable  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:24^U
@Tbetta9 Worst in the business. Go back to being the paddlepop Lion &amp; give the rest of us some peace. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:24^U
After this match, only 4 teams won't have played in a grand final since 2000. Carlton, the Suns &amp; North + the loser of this #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:26^U
#AFLTigersGiants soft free kicks killing this game#putthewhistlesaway#^2017-09-23 17:49:26^U

#AFLTigersGiants Tigers fetting a good run with umps^2017-09-23 17:49:27^U
No surprise to see the Rioli name dominate in finals  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:28^U
Richmond definitely getting away with a lot and seam to be protected a bit 🐸☕️ #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:28^U
When you can only listen to the game, so you gotta imagine the game play. 😐 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:29^U
Daniel Rioli! A bit of brilliance gets the Tigers a minor buffer. LIVE: https://t.co/L3WRH461Vs #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:29^U

Rioli having a significant game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:31^U
Rioli!! Living up to the name in finals.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:31^U
#AFLTigersGiants - this umpiring is like watching a referee when scum are playing at old Trafford #biased^2017-09-23 17:49:33^U
"He's got the name and he's got the finish!" That's a great call. Finally. Rioli with a superb goal. - NM #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:34^U
Coming in late to this whole Richmond thing but Daniel Rioli looks like some special talent. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:36^U
And Cotchin won't be playing in the GF if they make it 😂😂😂😂😂#EatPoo #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:37^U

I wonder if GWS will get a free kick anytime soon. Richmond getting rub of the green in a big way #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:43^U

Rioli is Aboriginal for 'finals magic'. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:48^U
Peter Bell on Rioli "Each of his 3 goals have been filled of class, what a find for the #Tigers he has been" #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:49:53^U
Forget Dusty - if you are GWS you need to shut down Rioli. He's been huge for the Tiges. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:55^U
The indigenous boys getting it down. Cameron last night and Rioli today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:55^U
Incredibly hard for GWS to win from here given they're carrying Lids/Steve J/DeBoer &amp; Shiel off injured.Too many passengers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:56^U
Another well constructed inside 50 for Richmond. Free kick, then rubbish holding the ball call, then another free kick. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:49:56^U
So it turns out that Richmond have a lot of fans. Who knew? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:00^U
Daniel Rioli is absolutely killing it on the ground tonight. Best man on ground, calling it now. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:50:02^U
Rioli a bit of a freak today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:02^U
Umps need to put the whistle away  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:50:02^U
20.5 passengers, half a Dustin Martin and a full Daniel Rioli. Enough? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:06^U
Shiel has had more than twice as many disposals as Deledio.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:07^U
Usually you have to pay extra for a Dusty Martin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:09^U
Rioli inspired by Charlie Cameron's efforts last night. Small forwards are doing the job. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:11^U
Those Riolis don't mind September #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:12^U
Somebody please smash Rioli #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:16^U

#AFLTigersGiants what is it about Rioli's &amp; September @AFL^2017-09-23 17:50:41^U
These umpires are being influenced by the crowd.  #AFLTigersGiants. And before you troll I am a Pies supporter^2017-09-23 17:50:42^U
Holding the ball as the player is tackled over the line one way but not the other 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:42^U
Holding the ball against Giants. Same on other side.  Throw it in.  😈 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 17:50:43^U
We all agree, 'sprint efforts' is the dumbest stat yet to be introduced to the AFL broadcast yeah?   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:50:47^U

Jeez, don't pick up the bill GWS players.. you'll get pinged straight away for holding the ball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:51:06^U
Richmond fans hope Cotch misses GF. Every premiership side since Jesus was crucified by the MRP have had a heart break tale #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:51:07^U

More calls in favour of the tigers, why don’t the umps just give the game to them #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:06^U
My point is that for GWS to deny die hard Richmond supporters a gf would be a travesty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:11^U
Is Richmond getting the rub with the umps at the moment?#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:15^U
Can anyone actually say that the umpires have not been drawn in by the crowd today? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:16^U
Poor effort by commentary team today - despite a great game happening #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:19^U
Tigers need to capitalise while they’re on top. GWS will come again #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:19^U

I'm used to watching a Rioli go big in September and it's nice to see one do it for a team I kinda like for once #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:26^U
38 free kicks paid already .   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 17:52:31^U

This umpiring is ruining a good game, absolutely shocking #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:32^U
Gee unlucky with the frees there Giants  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:32^U
The deliberate out of bounds. Results in a goal 👎🏼 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:32^U
Watch @7afl not even mention the crazy deliberate #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:33^U
Umps are making sure one Vic side will make the GF.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:34^U
Daniel Rioli take a bow! What a game so far! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:02:34^U
Rioli has FOUR!  Lethal: "And six tackles as well. An outstanding contribution!"  Tigers by 13. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:34^U
A Rioli in September. There's just something about it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:35^U
Did anyone predict this at the start of the season? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:36^U
Right on cue, umps #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:37^U

This deliberate OOB rule is a fkn Johnny come lately rule! Either be consistent or leave it out! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #CostAGoal^2017-09-23 18:02:39^U
The umpiring may or may not b technically correct, but they have certainly lost a sense of fairness.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:39^U
GWS have no hope if that is being paid. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:40^U
No way was that deliberate. A Giants player nearly marked it.#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:40^U
I say it again..... Rioli!!!! You just can't teach that #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/uwenrbBgwP^2017-09-23 18:02:40^U

#AFLTigersGiants @afl fix the rules. Umpire 15 is a goose. That was not deliberate out of bounds. Costs Giants a goal^2017-09-23 18:02:45^U
SHUT UP BASIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:45^U
Some very odd home-team umpire decisions. Looks like the AFL wants Richmond into the grand final. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:48^U
#AFLTigersGiants #BigV umpies get another HUGE goal assist after an extremely dodgy out of bounds decision @GWSGIANTS are playing agst 21^2017-09-23 18:02:48^U
Nice goal umpire, deliberate out of bounds has to be fixed up over the off season. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:51^U
If you win Richmond build a Rioli statue #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:51^U
Rioli is playing a solid game today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:51^U
Is it Basil commentating or Ben Fordham? Familiar monotone voice #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:52^U
You can see how badly the AFL need a Vic side in the grand final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:02:53^U

Another ridiculous  free kick to Richmond. How can it be deliberately put when there's a player there #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:03:04^U
@mattricho0 I thought 12 was the most famous number #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:03:04^U
I feel for @Adelaide_FC if this is the standard of umpiring that they have to deal with next weekend #noiseofaffirmation #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:03:04^U
Loving how the Tigers aren't required to handball and can just throw it to one another! Gold from the AFL! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:03:04^U

What an idiotic mistake #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:04:18^U
Last week's junk time goals by Stevie J worst thing that could've happened for GWS. Clearly not in their best 22. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:04:19^U
If Twitter is to be believed, the AFL is fixing this match so both GWS and Richmond win it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:04:19^U
If all you have to offer as a commentator is "they find a way" or "they need to find a way" you should be sacked #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:04:21^U

Whoever wins this, as much as it makes my black, white and real blood feel icky, Adelaide will win comfortably next week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:25^U
The handball because you can't kick the distance doesn't seem the ideal play against Richmond. In the mixer farken. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:26^U
Stevie J back in form. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:28^U

Steve Johnson = LIABILITY #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:50^U
Stevie J... you're done. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:51^U
Times up Stevie J #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:51^U
It's qtr 3 and I'm still wondering how we got to a point where Basil and Darcy are the best options to commentate a prelim. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:52^U
One game too many for Johnson. That’s a shame.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:05:52^U
Jeez. Trying to be too cute. What a ridiculous kick from Stevie J. Idiot. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:52^U
Mathew Nicholls: still the worst umpire in the league. Can't man the mark anymore? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:52^U
Never change Stevie J #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:53^U
Like the dogs last year, umpires again #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:53^U
If you can’t kick over 45m why are you in the side Stevie J? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:05:53^U
Oh Stevie ☹ #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:53^U
Hahaha Stevie J - never disappoints ;p #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:56^U
Stevie J. My heart breaks for a champion. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:56^U
Stevie J will cost GWS a spot in the Grand Final. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:57^U
Umpires able to follow HQ orders to openly favour @Richmond_FC as @GWSGIANTS have no fans to highlight the injustice. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:57^U
Game for Giants is unraveling around Steve Johnson. He's finding the ball but  butchering it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:05:58^U
The Stevie J looks to have been cancelled. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:00^U
If GWS make it surely Stevie J cant play if he cant kick goals from there #done #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:01^U
Stevie J you are a moron. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:03^U
Even Stevie wants Richmond to win. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:03^U
Well if Trent Cochin is not playing next week so is Stevie J..for totally different reasons  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:03^U

LMAO Stevie J!!!! Brain FART!!!!!#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:09^U
Leon Cameron has started on some really strong language. "Gosh", "golly" and "oh fudge" definitely dropped then. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:10^U
Stevie J brings the Richmond crowd to its feet! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:13^U
Two former Hawthorn assistant coaches and a Rioli kicking goals...   Feel like I'm in a parallel dimension.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:14^U
The Stevie J show looks to have been cancelled. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:15^U

Damn it, Lingy, shut up. Your voice is putting me off my footy. 🙎🏻‍♂️🔫 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:20^U
If GWS gets through to GF, Stevie J has to be dropped....absolute awful performance!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:24^U
Retire Johnson. You're a goose. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:24^U
Come on @Richmond_FC you gotta make them pay for that #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:25^U
Great career Stevie J but it's done #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:25^U

You're a hack Johnson. Get on the man shakes fat boy 😀😀#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:31^U
Tense game is tense #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:33^U
And that is why Stevie J was previously dropped. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:33^U
Stevie J #cooked #AFLTigersGiants #lastweekwasjunktimegoals https://t.co/OZTLeM4U4F^2017-09-23 18:06:34^U
If Stevie J cant kick 50m what's he doing out there ? And then gives 50m ! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:34^U
Patton reminds me of Hawkins 😕 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:35^U
@steviejohnson20 highlight reel... picks out a Tigers player. Good kick mate! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:36^U
#AFLTigersGiants get Stevie J off!!^2017-09-23 18:06:37^U
No junktime this week Stevie J #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:37^U
Listening to Cameron Ling's not-very-special comments  makes me feel like I'm losing the will to live. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:37^U
“Play on, advantage” when the opposition has them by the neck. Puzzling. #AFLFINALS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:39^U
Why!! do we!!! NEVER TACKLE !!!!! Don't just watch them run #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:40^U
So, you can literally run over Dusty and it's not an in the back, but accidently brush Stevie J with a fingertip and it is? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:40^U
OH SHIT! IMPLODING RIGHT NOW! GET A HOLD OF YOUR SHIT GWS!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:44^U
Leon Cameron happy about picking Stevie J and leaving out Devon Smith... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:46^U
And if Giants win Stevie J has just put himself out of the team. #AFLTigersGiants  #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:06:47^U
tfw you pick a cooked Stevie J over Devon Smith #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/TEXF3BD3fC^2017-09-23 18:06:51^U
Tigers MUST kill them off right here. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:54^U
Best game of the finals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:54^U
Stevie J should know better. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:55^U

Umpires have forgotten about the second team out on the G today.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:06:59^U
Johnsons career over #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:01^U
COME ON GIANTS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:02^U
Richmond cannot sit on this lead - put the foot/paw down!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:02^U
A knitting pattern would be more use than J Patton  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:06^U
If I had front row seats to the Stevie J show today, I'd be after a refund. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:07^U
Dusty puts a hit on Heath Shaw, then helps him up, says sorry, and asks him if he's wants to go on a bender #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:11^U
Bury them Tigers. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:11^U
Giants killing themselves here. Totally lost their way going forward. Steve Johnson a liability. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:07:11^U
Fuck me!!!! Stevie J what a joke #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:07:12^U
Has this quarter been going longer than the whole first half?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:12^U
I sense the crowd not liking Steve J, I can tell by the dB. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:13^U
Basil: Listen to the roar! *the one time the crowd is quiet* #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:17^U
Stevie J looks like the old guy in your local b grade footy team that should have retired a couple years ago #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:18^U
Stevie J would loooovvveee to have that last 5 minutes back #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:19^U
Giants look cooked 😳 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:21^U
Umpires cannot call advantage unless its clear. Players clearly cant hear the whistle, adjust you green numties #umpires #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:22^U
Stevie J's last game #farewell #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:24^U
Stevie J selection looking pretty terrible about now. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:25^U
Giants massively need another marking target up forward. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:07:26^U
Rioli is being billeted by the coach to cover Dusty's contract #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:28^U
If Johnson's was in the back, Martin must have been close to getting one, too. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:32^U
The Tiges want it more... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:32^U
#AFLTigersGiants I don't know much about AFL but you should always use your Nankervis!^2017-09-23 18:07:32^U
How to be a 7 commentator  - state the fucking obvious and keep babbling non stop crap about shit that may or may not happen#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:33^U
Based on this performance I reckon the AFL will give GWS a priority pick. #AFLTigersGiants AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:07:33^U
Never in my life would I've thought I'd be cheering on the Tigers. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:37^U
Christ the Eagles must be shit to allow Stevie J six goals last week. Looks years past it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:37^U
Thank you x2 Stevie J.  #doesntwanttokickthedistance #AFLTigersGiants  #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:07:39^U

Trent and Rioli have been huge for the Tigers tonight. Dustin has been decent too #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:40^U
Stop handballing Richmond! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:40^U
Showboating in a Preliminary final.......&amp; that's why  Geelong got rid of Steve J.  #AFLGiantsTigers  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:41^U
Yeah. Nah. Not buying GWS as a threat to Richmond. It'd take something special, even with a quarter left. - NM #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:41^U
Is Stevie J a sleeper agent for Richmond? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:42^U
Also loving this pre lim. Finally some interesting finals footy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:42^U
Tiger's paws and claws are taking hold #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:43^U
Stevie J footy skills and Basil Z commentary skills are equal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:46^U
Horror 5mins for the Giants #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:51^U
Win or lose, this Stevie J's last game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:52^U
#AFLTigersGiants Stevie J should never have been out there^2017-09-23 18:07:53^U
I want to call Basil Captain Cliche but he's just not that good!  Corporal Cliche maybe? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:53^U
@notthefakeSVP better wake up and fire up the satellite tv. Got a barn burner in the AFL Grand Finals. #AFLTigersGiants @StanfordSteve82^2017-09-23 18:07:54^U
.@Richmond_FC Could put some space between here if they put the foot down. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:55^U
Too early to sit on the edge of seat! Not far from it?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:07:58^U
I find entire boundary fence video #advertising #MCG VERY distracting @Channel7 coverage trying to watch the actual game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:04^U
GWS need one before the break else I can’t see them getting the win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:09^U
Nankervis recruit of the year?  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:08:10^U
Cotchin playing an inspired second quarter. Shame it’s gonna be his last game of the year. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:11^U
GWS are giving this away #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:13^U
Cameon Ling &amp; Luke Darcy are shocking @7AFL  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:15^U
Everyone said stevie J cost GWS the prelim last year by getting suspended but hes doing the same this year but hes playing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:16^U

What qualifications do you need to be a special comments man? I can state the obvious as good as Ling and Richo. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:22^U
Stevie J more of a hindrance than a help at this stage #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:08:24^U
This @MCG crowd puts @AllianzStadium to shame #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:08:25^U

Hell, poor decision making by the Giants all around. Back to back prelim losses are coming their way. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:02^U
Few A grade players exposed today, Reiwold, Greene, Patton,Shaw, #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:02^U
Do the channel 7 commentators realise that Richmond is actually playing another team? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:02^U
Cotchin playing an inspired second half. Shame it’s gonna be his last game of the year. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:03^U
Inboard to a three on one. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/fuioO7Rao6^2017-09-23 18:09:06^U
20 points never insurmountable but this game is over #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:08^U
Giants are cooked. Losing a mid so early, and such a good one in  shiel is hurting badly #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:08^U
Hey @GWSGIANTS if you could finish playing the game - that'd be great. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:12^U
Giants have way bigger issues than a couple of bad umpiring calls #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:14^U
This game is legitimately garbage... #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:09:15^U

Really hope Cotch doesn't get done. Bloke deserves the game. And you don't rub someone out for that. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:50^U
Getting a bit concerning due the Giants. Really look like they're breaking down under pressure. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:09:50^U

For all the good Tomlinson has done, it means nothing when you do that. Very costly mistake, that may break GWS' back #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:03^U
@FitzySA Leon Cameron has completely lost control of the “Ferrari” #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:03^U
How is this super average Richmond team winning a prelim? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:05^U
Giants are done. The upside is the Vic Public Holiday on Friday will be well supported. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:05^U
Alright Leon Cameron. Time to earn your money. They're not working anywhere near hard enough. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:06^U
From what I've seen this afternoon, the premiership is Adelaide's to lose. These teams look a tad fatigued #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:07^U
GWS might have the most talented list in the comp, but it sure looks like when the going gets tough, they just give up. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:07^U

It's impressive how well Richmond are playing without Troy Chaplin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:19^U
This commentating is terrible. They talk like Richmond have already won and they don't even know what the frees are for #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:20^U

Richmond can’t win next week without Cotchin. One of the biggest tribunal calls of all time #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:10:32^U

Well then. Richmond looking good. But if any team is going to lose it from here...it's Richmond. #Richmondy #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:50^U
If anyone can lose it from here, it's Richmond. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:51^U
From here, only Richmond....#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:51^U
Have seven munted the crowd noise? it sounds muffled #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:52^U
Tigers have not won until the siren - none of this 'dare to dream' nonsense! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:53^U
Remember that scene in Game of Thrones... you know the one, battle of the bastards... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:11:56^U
That wasn't a mark get fucked umpires are a fucking joke this shit is more setup than WWE #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:11:57^U
Hahaah and Cotchin won't be playing in the GF hahahahah😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:00^U

Go Tigerboys! Eat 'Em Alive! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:01^U
Bog standard 'only Richmond could lose it from here' tweet #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:01^U
Richmond will win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:02^U
Giants are done. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:03^U
@GWSGIANTS are playing @Richmond_FC and the umps, but even so, their beginner skills don't deserve the win right now. 😔 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:03^U
Not sure who's happier, Richmond fans or the manufacturers of the decibel meter  for all this free advertising... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:05^U
Game over. Giants cooked and Richmond getting the rub of the yellow. 'Twas fun while it lasted I suppose #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:07^U
Stevie J’s six goals after the game was over really flattered him, as he showed today by torching 2 shots at goal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:07^U
@JoshKelly22_  might be regretting he signed 2 year deal #AFLTigersGiants #tigertime^2017-09-23 18:12:08^U
Stevie J and Heath Shaw both getting new arseholes torn. Couldn't happen to 2 bigger dickheads #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:08^U
I'm sure I speak for all Tigers supporters when I say I'm still not feeling super confident #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:08^U
95,000 at the MCG for #AFLTigersGiants GF qualifier. What finals football should be! #theliveexperience #itsaboutshowingup^2017-09-23 18:12:08^U
Dropped chest mark. Goal Richmond. Umpires well on the bandwagon. TV don't show replay. Richmond benefit. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:09^U
I wish I could get paid to commentate entirely about how loud the crowd is #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:09^U
Can hear the MCG from St Kilda! #AFLTigersGiants #yellowandblack 🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛^2017-09-23 18:12:10^U
#AFLTigersGiants  Put 'em away boys!!  #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:12:11^U
Richmond have had this on their terms most of the day, what a well rounded performance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:12^U
BTW, we're giving punters $2 for Dusty to win the #Brownlow by 2 or more votes.  PROMO: https://t.co/VAJa05JWUt  #AFLTigersGiants #Brownlow^2017-09-23 18:12:12^U
You know you’re playing the worst game of your life when you’re trending... #steviej #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:12^U
Which Sports director at 7 thinks Lings dribble on every finals match is a winner?  Are they that deaf to public opinion?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:13^U
So, what? 17 tickets available next week for Adelaide fans? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants #AFL^2017-09-23 18:12:13^U
"How loud will this be if he kicks it?" Ask Lingy you fuckwit. You missed the start of the 2nd qtr with his dB meter. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:14^U

Even marks in AFL that are not marks are marks. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:18^U
Some of the Richmond side looks like they should be in prison. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:18^U
Eat em alive @Richmond_FC #Tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:19^U
Good to see the umps helping the Victorian team this year #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:20^U
Officially Tiger Time. - NM #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/51NnSmEzLH^2017-09-23 18:12:20^U
Let's hope the umpires aren't so distracted by a home crowd in the big dance #AFLTigersGiants #AFLfinals #freekickrichmond^2017-09-23 18:12:21^U
Giants refuse to run back when they don't have the ball.   Supposedly to the best running side. #AflFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:21^U
Really GWS? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/CLloFMsiEJ^2017-09-23 18:12:24^U
#AFLTigersGiants once again too many rock stars. Draft some #nofrills players next season.^2017-09-23 18:12:24^U

How Richmondy would it be to win today and get flogged next? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:12:42^U
GWS have lost the plot here. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:46^U
Sorry Richo, but in #afl footy, 4 goal is 4 goals, not nothing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:51^U
Wonderful insight from the ch7 team. Apparently 95k people can be loud, prelims are hard matches &amp; the next goal important #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:54^U
Tigers will need to bring their A+ game next week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:54^U
Harrison Himmelberg out there looking like a Sons of Anarchy character #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:54^U
Duuuuusty!!! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/V2vuCI86EV^2017-09-23 18:12:58^U

Himmelbergs black eye there not assisting his shot on goal. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:59^U
#AFLTigersGiants don't like Shaw on Martin in the square,^2017-09-23 18:12:59^U
Didn't really want Richmond to win, but when it's against the AFL's bitches... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:12:59^U
Oh fuck me dead Himmelberg #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:13:00^U
Can they hold on #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:00^U
Drinking lots of beer! Holding up well. Been told l'll probably/suddenly be fucked some time during the 4th. Wot? #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:13:05^U
Not sure which selection was worse. Giants going for Stevie J over Devon Smith or ch7 going for basil in the comm box #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:05^U
This really is getting away from the Giants. 😕 #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/JMQ57y1WfT^2017-09-23 18:13:07^U
That's a fair shiner on Himmelberg... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:07^U
Giants are the weakest team I've seen play in a finals series(bar Essendon). The coach needs to be sacked  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:07^U
IS IT HAPPENING? ARE WE DOING IT? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/8wcPjw3tSr^2017-09-23 18:13:08^U
Seriously rattled. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:09^U
Shanked it! Yesssss! #GoTiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:10^U
Ye Gods! What is going on out there??? Giants missing proverbial side of the barn.   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:11^U
Richmond's strategy to knock out Dylan Shiel in the first quarter has really paid dividends. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:12^U
Harrison Hindenburg just exploded with that shanked kick. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:13^U
I normally give umps a fair go, but this has been a disgrace. Tigers almost gifted this game.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:14^U
Should of gone to speak savers number 27. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:17^U
Himmelberg sporting a shiner? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:17^U
Don’t kick it to Stevie J. @GWSGIANTS #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFInals^2017-09-23 18:13:17^U
Giants look cooked. Richmond intensity building. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:13:20^U
Giants too cute with the footy around the packs, sometimes just gotta hack it fwd. On the boot. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:29^U
We get it @BasilZempilas, it's loud #AFLTigersGiants #giveitarest^2017-09-23 18:13:34^U
#AFLTigersGiants AFL have ruined the sport. Tigers don't even need to hold a mark to be awarded it. Tigers fikthy^2017-09-23 18:13:36^U
Can himmelberg even see out of his left eye? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:39^U
GWS deflated since the shocking deliberate call. Poor decision affecting the momentum of the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:39^U
Bringing up Phil Spector. Basil really is shit. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:39^U
Hmm some people flourish under pressure, whilst others don't. #finalsfooty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:40^U
Basil working some Phil Spectre gear now? High risk. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:13:41^U
Cotchin playing like a man who knows he’s not playing next week. #BeastMode #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:44^U
That's it Dustin mRtin kicks the tigers into the grand final well done #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:13:45^U
It's fine I'm going for Richmond because of Kath Day-Knight, right?! 🐯 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #KathAndKim^2017-09-23 18:13:46^U
Brett Deledio playing? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:13:51^U

oh christ please let Dusty be ok #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:08^U
Heath Shaw finally has an impact on the game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:10^U
Great to hear the commentators willing Richmond over the line #AFLTigersGiants #VFL^2017-09-23 18:14:10^U
Costania is pure garbage.. had an open goal 2 metres out 😂😂  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:11^U
Trent Cotchin. Captains Game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:11^U
Come on Tigers! Send em packing back to the goldy. @AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:13^U
Too bad that Cotchin won't be playing next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:13^U
Wow Tigers looking good here! Cmon giants! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:14:15^U
Surely the tigers can't lose from here. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:16^U
@Julesschiller Gone the early crow Jules. Speaking of which, well done Crows on winning the 2017 AFL Grand Final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:16^U
Dusty going to be pissing blood tonight and will have to phone his dad for advice on how to deal with it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:20^U
You can actually hear the commentators booing whenever a GWS player has a shot at goal. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:22^U

That's a drink! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/0Sh1jLdQue^2017-09-23 18:14:29^U
Cotchin does not deserve to miss out next week because of the Shiel incident. Absolute shambles if so.. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:30^U
Anybody complaining about the umps having similar colours to Richmond?? #AFLTigersGiants  #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:14:31^U
#AFLTigersGiants had to be a free to Castagna, never got close to the ball!^2017-09-23 18:14:31^U
Don't know if Basil should be referencing Phil Spector. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:14:31^U
In all seriousness though, I really hope the tigers don't pull off a @1997Bulldogs final quarter. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:32^U
did the commentators want to  commentate the actual football rather than the volume of the crowd ?? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:36^U
Last bloke to play a Grand Final with broken ribs won a Norm Smith. #JustSayin #Dusty #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:14:37^U
Haven't handled the heat at all in this term the Giants, won't be a great review #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:37^U
Trent Cotchin critics can all suck a lemon, what a performance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:37^U
Oh, Jack Riewoldt IS playing today.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:14:38^U
Cotchin massive this game. Just incredible influence. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:39^U
Ok, I admit to being on the bandwagon #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:14:41^U
umpiring is fully fuckin cooked #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:42^U
This does have the making of the perfect finish. The Termites thinking they're home, only for GWS to win after the siren. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:43^U
So Jack gets pinned for a push but two Tigers were held, over the shoulder, and nothing. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:49^U
Done and Dust'd #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:50^U
Making a Grand Final but Cotchin out suspended and Martin out injured would be a fairly Richmond thing. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:50^U
Has Rievolt has a kick? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:53^U
Dusty might have broken ribs. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:54^U
It's a good thing that the ch 7 commentary team aren't doctors. Literally don't know arses from elbows. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:55^U
Eddie: You can't rub Cochin out, he's the Tigers captain. Dermott: Doesn't come into it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:56^U
Dusty is not well!! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:56^U
Giants have to get one here to have the momentum going into the last term. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:57^U
Obviously these commentators weren't at 2002 or 2003 Prelims where #GoPies played interstate sides. Or 2010. #decibelmetre #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:58^U
It's been 34 years, 11 months, 30 days... but @Richmond_FC fans.. we are off the bloody Grand Final!!!! 🐯   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:59^U
fucking dived. Should play for the Italian Diving Team (soccer) #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:14:59^U
Not one of Ch7 commentators has noticed that Himelberg can hardly see out of one eye due to a hit he copped in first qtr #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:06^U
Giants players going to great lengths to avoid winning a Tissot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:06^U
Dusty will have a field day in the last quarter #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:08^U
Who's #1? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants #AFLCrowCats^2017-09-23 18:15:09^U
Geez the Giants copping some awful calls from the Unpires. Obviously he AFL has decided they want Tigers in the GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:11^U
Luke Darcy gets his opinions from the newspapers @7AFL  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:11^U
#Basil proving that his inept commentary of the swimming was no fluke #consistentlyawful #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:14^U
It might be hard for Richmond to do a Richmondy thing from here?  But then again... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:16^U
Really not wanting another week of Richmond nonsense. Please come back, GWS GIants. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:16^U
Stevie J is the right selection choice #saidnooneever #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:17^U

Absolutely huge from @tcotchin9  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:19^U
#AFLTigersGiants Guys, Rance is a good player, but that was a 2 vs 1 and the Richmond player took out the GWS player. He is so overhyped.^2017-09-23 18:15:20^U
One way or the other, there will be Tiger tears at the G tonight #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:21^U
@JackRiewoldt08 embarrassing himself tonight #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:22^U

Oh well. At least I’ll get to watch Eddie win his first gf #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:27^U
Luke Hodge won a Norm Smith medal with broken ribs. What will Dusty do? 🤔🤔 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:15:29^U
Giants playing like a team that lacks leadership #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:29^U
The Richmond bandwagon may be groaning under the strain but it's GWS whose wheels have come off #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:31^U
Stop looking around for a handball off the mark - kick the bloody thing!!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:33^U
Richmond leads by 25.  The same margin they led GWS at the final change in round 9...  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:35^U
Umpires confused Dusty with Auskick Dusty from the NAB ads to pay that “mark” #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:15:37^U

Good vibes for Tigers, but let's not yet forget a few things this club is famous for. History beckons for these men  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:01^U
Not a free. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:01^U
These umpires need to put it away... 46 frees paid to 3/4 time. And that was soft af in the goal square #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:02^U
Can someone loan me some $ i have a lock next weekend #crows #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:02^U

Tigers by 31 at 3/4 time.  Surely couldn't lose from here.  If anyone could though...  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:17:11^U
Hope they don't pay those free kicks in the @AFL Grand Final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:12^U
Nice try umpires none of you will get a go next week and the Crows will walk all over the Tigers without your help #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:12^U
It's a shit free Ricoh, plain and simple, he grabbed Shawry first. These commentators are a joke #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:13^U
Congrats richmond  Too good #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:14^U
Gotta say, footy really is ruined when the umpires decide they want one team to win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:16^U
Horrendous call. Don't need that when they're getting pumped already #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:16^U

Followed up by the worst call of the year... thanks for coming umpires. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:42^U
The lids off! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:43^U
Steve Johnson and Heath Shaw have just written-off the Ferrari that quarter  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:44^U
Only 1/2 hour to go! @Richmond_FC you can do IT!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:45^U
Dustin Martin oh my word. . . What an athlete! 🐯 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:17:45^U
This umpiring has summed up the AFL standards and performance in 2017. Pathetic .#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:46^U
The premiership quarter has split the men from the boys. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:46^U
#AFLTigersGiants  How many times has that happened to @Buddy_Franklin this year ...AND NOTHING!!! piss off richmond^2017-09-23 18:17:47^U
Bombers supporter @afl game - yellow &amp; black + flouro yellow! Disgusting umpiring #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:48^U
The intensity. I can’t deal. #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges^2017-09-23 18:17:48^U
Ah...wear was Shaw holding there? Dusty had a handful!! Umpire 21 got the memo there 😣😌😣#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:49^U
That is a soft free kick especially in a final from the umpires. Nothing in it at all. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:52^U
Game over. Giants don't look anywhere near likely. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:54^U
I think Dustin Martins dad has had a chat with the umpires and there family's. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:55^U
Biggest 3/4 comeback in 2017 to win a match 25 points GWS v RICH R09  #AFLTigersGiants @GWSGIANTS @Richmond_FC #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:17:55^U
Geez I hope Dusty's not injured.  That would be the ultimate anti climax #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:55^U
That wasn't a freekick. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:56^U
Obviously the AFL wants a Victorian team in the GF #AFLTigersGiants #poorumpiringagain^2017-09-23 18:17:56^U
Can we start talking about clash jumpers yet? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:17:57^U
Imagine if the Tigers lose it from here.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:58^U
Absolute fkn disgrace @afl. Umps being influenced by the crowd like never before.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:58^U
Josh Jenkins was right when he said the Giants don't run both ways. No ticker!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:17:59^U
God this is worth it just to watch the look on Heath Shaw and Toby Greene's faces.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:00^U
Umpiring is ridiculously biased for Richmond. Yes they're at the G, but do your job umpires and officiate a fair game. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:00^U
@7AFL #AFLTigersGiants @BasilZempilas not sure Phil Spector is the ideal role model to be quoting on a family sports broadcast?^2017-09-23 18:18:01^U

#AFLTigersGiants Geelong defence was 'pathetic' Lingy.^2017-09-23 18:18:03^U
For a team that are so good at finishing off close games, it's odd to no see many Richmond fans claim the win already.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:03^U
Wow #AFLTigersGiants one of the worst prelims I've watched.... skills 👀💁^2017-09-23 18:18:03^U
Not a supporter of either team but geez tigers are getting a good deal from umpires 😡umpires shouldn't decide games#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:03^U
Thats a bad free kick to Dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:03^U
Game over. Giants making too many bad decisions and skill errors. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:04^U
Still wanting to see the replay of Martin being held.  Oh, that was it? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:04^U
That's a joke umpires. Play fair at least #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:05^U
Even Richmond couldn’t fuck this up  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:06^U
It's now the Tigers game to choke and lose.. so game on  #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:08^U
What. A. Quarter. Rioli doing Rioli things was sensational #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges^2017-09-23 18:18:08^U
Dusty very sore judging by the subdued celebration... didn't want his teammates jumping all over him #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:08^U
Is there a Punt road end? Fuck me use google maps and find another landmark #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:09^U
AFL are doing their very best to ensure another fairy tale.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:09^U
Putrid by the umpires. If that's a hold by Shaw then you can officially rename this netball #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:10^U
That was real tough against shaw #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:10^U
Did we just witness 'The Premiership Quarter'???  #GoTiges #GTFMT  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:13^U
Still nervous as fuck #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:13^U
Richmond slaying GWS in this game. Hoping the Tiges keep it up, would love to see them in the GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:13^U
Pretty clear @AFL don't want a non #Victorian grand final. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:14^U
Hello Brett Deledio, are you out there?? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:15^U
South Australians and Richmond fans out in force in Melbourne next week; and you though Apex were bad... #AFLGrandFinal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:16^U
@JackRiewoldt08 is a talentless flog. Shown up again in a big match. #fraud #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/wywUzDFnRk^2017-09-23 18:18:16^U
Oh no.Just no @afl umpires.150 years old this game and it has not left AUS shores because it is officiated by total retards #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:17^U
Stevie J and Deledio have been massive fails in this match. Experience means nothing when you can't help the team #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:17^U
Dusty grabs a handful of Shaw's jumper. Free kick Dusty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:17^U
The Vic Govt will be loving this. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #PubHolFri^2017-09-23 18:18:17^U
'The Richmond fans are starting to think Grand Final time.' No we're not. We're contemplating the ways this could go wrong. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:18^U
Cotchin been outsanding. No way he can play in the gf though, but he will because as if the MRP will get it right #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:18^U

Premiership F*****g Quarter. #gotiges  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:19^U
Did anyone honestly think GWS were a chance, the AFL is a business and Richmond was the better option for its business. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:21^U
Tigers lead by 31 at three quarter time. Tigers v Crows grand final will be epic.  #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/AdBTGp2Ii2^2017-09-23 18:18:21^U

it's only 5 fucking goals FFS and the Giants can NOT be discounted #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:23^U
These commentators are insanely bad @7AFL, any chance we can do better next week #FFS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:23^U
Adelaide &gt; Richmond next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:24^U
#AFLTigersGiants the only silver lining to this is Cotchin missing the GF for being a piece of shit^2017-09-23 18:18:24^U
And, look out Adelaide. Tiges blowing all the nerves out this week. #AFLTigersGiants They'll be bringing it next week.^2017-09-23 18:18:25^U
Hard to imagine how you could be so insipid in such a big qtr of footy #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:25^U

Richmond are comfortably the better side, but really, the bias of the umpires &amp; commentators is amateur stuff. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:30^U

Umpiring at its worst today  #AFLTigersGiants @AFL @Robbo_heraldsun @7AFL^2017-09-23 18:18:32^U

3/4 time and Richmond are up by 31pts. Kicking to the Punt Road end in the last term. Yeah this is done. - NM #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:35^U
Watch the dirty Giants come out in the last quarter a try to hurt as many @Richmond_FC players as possible #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:35^U
Another shocker by the umps! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/J7OF4cjJEi^2017-09-23 18:18:36^U
Unbelievable bias against GWS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:36^U

Great quarter from the Tiges ! Just sheer effort &amp; desire. Cotchin immense &amp; Rioli sprinkling the magic dust #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:41^U
I think I speak for most of Melbourne when I say I feel physically ill. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:41^U
I think the only thing Adelaide have to worry about next week is playing 25 players #AFLTigersGiants #FreeKickRichmond^2017-09-23 18:18:42^U
Heath Shaw playing on Dusty is about as equitable as the Washington Generals playing against the Globetrotters. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:42^U

With a qtr to go and Martin hasn’t played in midfield, Cotchin playing like 2 men @PureBeno #huge #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:49^U
When you don’t even follow the Tigers but are getting caught up in the hype. Go Tigers!!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:49^U
Adelaide must strongly request that the #AFLTigersGiants umpires DO NOT umpire the Grand Final.^2017-09-23 18:18:51^U
I think that the MCG is literally about to explode #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:18:52^U

Richmond charity #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:53^U
Richmond in a grand final brings back memories of Woewoedin winning the brownlow. Worst team in the GF that I can recall. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:18:53^U

No Cotchin in the grand final is going to be tough. Richmond would have lost without him today. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:12^U
GWS to be awarded a priority pick after missing out on consecutive grand final berths #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:12^U

Not sure umpires from this match will have much on next Saturday. Mad Monday coming up for these lads!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:30^U
Giants look out on their feet. Rioli and Nankervis been huge for the #Tigers   #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:31^U
Probably going to need five public holidays. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #GoTigers^2017-09-23 18:19:33^U
4th quarter #RICHMONDY #NOTTHISYEAR #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:34^U
Only threat to the Crows is the Richmond bandwagon driven by the umpires. Never seen anything like it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:34^U
Quarter to go boys.  Bring it home.  #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges #copingbetternow https://t.co/Vk849wOtiI^2017-09-23 18:19:32^U
Dear West Coast, thanks for letting Stevie J kick 6 and   thus allowing him to be selected tonight. Regards, Richmond. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:34^U
#AFLTigersGiants that holding call has happened literally thousands of times all year for no free. WHYYYY call it in a prelim??!!!^2017-09-23 18:19:34^U
46 free kicks in 3/4 of football, most of them soft. Umps have had too much influence on this one#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:34^U
It's Richmond, games for them are only 3 qtrs #AFLTigersGiants #comeback^2017-09-23 18:19:35^U
Dusty and Rioli were the stand out players for the tigers tonight.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:35^U
Time to put the foot down! #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:19:36^U
GWS workrate in that quarter was disgraceful. Their only hope is if Rich players start thinking about preservation for GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:37^U
Come on you Tigers!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:38^U
Looks like the Tigers will be playing in the GF... without Cotchin, with his record sadly it's one week at best #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:40^U
Tigers easily the better team (less mistakes, more def. accountability &amp; pressure) but getting rub of green. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:19:40^U
Some of the decisions made by GWS makes me think they punted their footy trip money on the tiger #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:43^U
Only one team could lose from 31 points up at 3/4 time in a prelim #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:46^U
From the sound of it, every TV on this ward is tuned to the #AFLTigersGiants game. So who am I to buck the trend? #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:19:46^U
The only thing positive from #AFLTigersGiants is that the GF loss will be fantastic to watch^2017-09-23 18:19:48^U
#AFLTigersGiants what a shocking game. Not even subtle the free ride Richmond are getting^2017-09-23 18:19:48^U
These umpires simply should not be allowed to officiate next week. Gifting this game to Richmond #AFLTigersGiants #AFL #Farce^2017-09-23 18:19:50^U
Umpiring a disgrace. Can't give in to the crowd like this in a prelim... this trio can start planning their holiday. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:19:51^U

Time to dust off the canary yellow guernseys for next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:20:22^U
Umpires need to realise thier role is to officiate the game, not help achieve a fairytale outcome for the crowd. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:20:24^U
The AFL clearly want Richmond in the grand final for financial reasons.. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/pgzv6vqtkh^2017-09-23 18:20:24^U

I'm sick of these commentators sucking up martins ass. There's other players on the field that just him  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:20:44^U

Now the @GWSGIANTS have decided to stop playing in the 3rd quarter, I'll start tweeting NZ election. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:20:56^U

Giants. A team full of "superstars" who go to water 40m out on a 40° angle. Basics win big games. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:25^U
Will the Australian Federal Police investigate the AFL and the umpires? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:26^U

I'm honestly going to combust. What is this. Is this happening? Am I asleep? Awake? In the twilight zone? I just do anymore #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:30^U

A disgraceful decision! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/I5DUyg8pYZ^2017-09-23 18:21:34^U
DeBoer, StevieJ and Taranto need to take some scalps in 4th Q for their team. They won't play GF anyway. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:35^U
Seriously I want Trent Cotchin to get suspended just so Jack Riewoldt can lift the cup. He deserves it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:36^U
I didn’t know Richmond had this many fans, where have they been all this time? #AFLTigersGiants #FairweatherFans^2017-09-23 18:21:36^U

The final quarter is the test, will they play like Richmond, or a team that wants to play the GF. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:42^U
tigers are fierce but would get punished by a far superior side then the giants #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:21:42^U

Dear ch7 spuds, there are 2 teams playing today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:22:01^U
#AFLTigersGiants Why is Dustin Martin still on the ground? Clearly bleeding from his arm, the lead shouldn't be this large right now.^2017-09-23 18:22:02^U
This game would be a lot closer if Cotchin wasn’t such a dirty hack. At least either way he’ll be watching the GF on TV. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:22:02^U

I live in Richmond and can hear the Tiges fans at the G... over my TV #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:22:59^U
Martin and Shaw were both holding each other! Umpire pays free kick to forward! 🤔🤡😡 @Karl6pr @MitchellGlenn #AFLTigersGiants @AFL^2017-09-23 18:23:02^U

this will be classic Richmond if they lose this #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:06^U
Giants will never win a GF let alone a prelim if their mids only ever run forward #onewayrunners #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:07^U

Every kick for the rest of this quarter from GWS needs to be a Malcolm Blight Torry....! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:18^U
They're 31 points up and just one quarter from their first GF in 35 years! #AFLTigersGiants #GoTiges @Richmond_FC https://t.co/QqX7PaM4MC^2017-09-23 18:23:21^U
The impact of taking out arguably Giants best player in the 1st qtr has been immense don't know if I'm feeling a comeback #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:22^U

#AFLTigersGiants there will be a Vic team no matter what the price, SOLD the integrity of the game^2017-09-23 18:23:27^U
#AFLTigersGiants Gil &amp; his crony mate Demetriou will be very upset if the Tigers get there - so much hatred for the club^2017-09-23 18:23:27^U
Sweet Jesus Ch 7  I beg you  Whatever Cometti wants to get him back for the GF... pay it  Your commentary teams R abysmal  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:28^U
How much is Richmond going to spend on lawyers this week? #cotchinintrouble  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:29^U
Who remembers Orange Empty Seat? I don't even watch AFL but I remember being in a convo with him that got me blocked by GWS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:29^U
Be careful what you say @BasilZempilas ....@Richmond_FC still have one close lose left in them this year #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:32^U
Can @Channel7 loosen the vice around Ling's nuts? His pitch is terrible! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/sDiwiitO7N^2017-09-23 18:23:33^U
Some super chopper shots over the G tonight ...great work whoever’s piloting and operating camera #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:35^U
This is like, the second non-Lions or non-Suns game I've watched all season... Don't let me down, GWS. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:35^U
#AFLTigersGiants so great to have a Rioli light up the finals^2017-09-23 18:23:41^U
31 point lead in the last quarter. Now is your time Junk Time Jack. Show the world how great you can be! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:42^U
Well the G has never looked better. (I mean @MCG not to be confused with the @GWSGIANTS who've never looked worse) #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:43^U
If you want definition of hypocrisy listen to S.A radio this week How Sloane should get off but Cotchin must be rubbed out #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:43^U
There’s nothing better than seeing the front running @GWSGIANTS  wankers get it handed to them!!! Again in a prelim 😊 hahah #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:44^U
Was hoping for Adelaide-Richmond GF this week, would/will be the better contest. Finish them Tiges. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:52^U
Slam the door shut this quarter boys. No mercy. #gotiges #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:53^U
lol whats with this Dusty bloke, does he think he’s in the NRL or something? Thug #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:53^U
Currently going through my mind - every single heartbreaking loss. Deep breaths needed. #GoTiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:23:55^U
So only 17k members and no Cotchin in the GF. Bittersweet week ahead for the Tuggers #AFLTigersGiants #AFLcrowstigers^2017-09-23 18:23:55^U
#AFLTigersGiants I'm afraid 'the Pride of South Australia' has it in the bag n/week^2017-09-23 18:24:00^U

C'mon Giants. Gotta be clean from here #NeverSurrender #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:24:32^U
There will be more than 60 free kicks paid in this game! Not sure they have helped the game as a spectacle. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:24:33^U
How does a player do 720 and not get a free against?#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:24:35^U

Dusty. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/8rIylP6qzP^2017-09-23 18:25:30^U
Really makes Dangerfield and Deledio think twice about changing clubs. That's why people love one club players  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:32^U
Cotchin has been excellent in his last game for the year. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:33^U
Dusty is the only thing that's good about this game. A joy to watch #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:33^U
I think I can mute #RichmondTV for the rest of the game. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:25:34^U

If Richmond blows this I desperately wanna hear the decibel meter #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:43^U
@BasilZempilas  just came all over Cotchin.  Knobrider. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/uBYNnfORvw^2017-09-23 18:25:42^U

Hard to win a game without your best player for 3 quarters #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:48^U
As good as the Tigers have been, the Giants have shown zero composure when needed. Some shocking decision making #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:48^U
Cotchin turning it on in his last game of the season #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:48^U
#AFLTigersGiants dan Andrews can rest easy now.  His stupid public holiday will have one Vic club again. Some cash for AFL on its way.^2017-09-23 18:25:49^U
You watch, the umps will give the Giants a lot of cheapies in this quarter after it appears the Termites are home. #AFLTigersGiants. #cheats^2017-09-23 18:25:53^U
Can someone please go and check on @erinrileyau? I think @bernietb might lose it completely at this #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:56^U
Mark Maclure "Cotchin has been awesome. He may not play next week but gee whiz, he's going to get them to the Grand Final" #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:25:57^U

"There's absolutely nothing Dusty Martin can't do" - Really @7AFL, can he eat his own head? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:06^U
I don't mind basil in my pesto but keep it from the commentary please #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:07^U
#AFLTigersGiants  So the Adelaide v Richmond grand final to be played at The Adelaide Oval next week, yeah?^2017-09-23 18:26:09^U
Lets just hope the MRP doesn't do a dick move and make Cotchin miss the Grand Final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:09^U
He is literally untouchable. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:11^U
G-juz. Someone just run onto the field and give him the Brownlow Medal… #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:11^U
@DustinMartin4 should be a brand. Just a superstar.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:12^U
Is @BasilZempilas barracking for the Tigers and calling the game at the same time @7AFL #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:13^U
Tigers fans about to have the week of their lives. Pity they’re playing Adelaide. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:13^U

What the fuck is with these Giants boys and their weak shoulders? Get these cunts on the lat flys over the summer. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:18^U
Fact: Dusty is worth 3 times more than buddy, he's a game winner !  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:26:18^U

Dusty, Nank, Rance, Caddy and Jack wrapped in cotton wool. Now. Forget Cotch, this is his last game of the year. #cooked #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:27:08^U
It's amazing how good it feels watching the Tiges knowing how happy their supporters will be. Good on them. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:27:08^U

The crowd at this stadium right now is on fire as around 90k Richmond supporters realize they're in the Grand Final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:28:14^U
So could be two years in a row that the actual captain of a team doesn't play in the Grand Final.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:28:14^U
Giants look flat, so I'll call it. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:28:14^U
The big question is how do the AFL get Trent Cotchin off? By their own rules he has to miss #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:28:16^U
Stevie J kicking 6 last week was the worst thing that could've happened to the Giants. Where is Devon Smith? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:28:17^U

Only one good finals game from a neutrals perspective this year and...I wasn't a neutral. Shit September.  Up the 🐯  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:30:42^U
If Dusty doesn't win the Brownlow it'll be the second biggest travesty behind Jeremy Howes non-inclusion in the All-Oz team #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:30:45^U

Seems Cotch is trying his guts out to get his team across the line as he knows he may not be there next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:31:34^U
Trent Cotchin will only get suspended/fined if the Tigers dont make the grand final #AFLTigersGiants #doublestandards^2017-09-23 18:31:36^U

Cotchin has been unbelievable. Too bad he's played his grand final both literally and metaphorically today #willgetaweek #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:31:46^U
#AFLTigersGiants  How the hell does Richmond make a GF? Shows the calibre of footy isn't what it was last 5-10 years.^2017-09-23 18:31:47^U
As a Freo fan I'm pleased to see Matty de Boer having a decent day of it, even if the result isn't going his way #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:31:47^U
Losing from here is so something Richmond would do. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:31:47^U
Ok so I'm REALLY not a fan of Cameron Ling as a commentator... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:31:49^U
*slow clap* AFL. You finally get a NSW team into a GF qualifying position, then make sure the umpires keep them out #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:31:51^U

@Kate_ohalloran What now for the Giants? Another year down the drain.They won't have this talent at their disposal forever. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:25^U
Spare a moment for the security guard at Zagames tonight #AFLTigersGiants #tobygreene^2017-09-23 18:33:28^U
As a richmond supporter I am disappointed to hear the booing directed at @BrettDeledio07 #poorform #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:29^U
Fair to say Richmond will be hosting a Grand Final next week against the minor premiers. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:31^U
In 2 finals, Tigers have played 2 teams with toothless forward lines. Up against the Crows will be a much different story. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:38^U
Those booing Deledio - Shame on you. #AFLTigersGiants #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:33:39^U

Trent just keeps Cotchin the ball hahahahahahaha. God I hate football #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:45^U
It's not going to happen, but how good would it be from here.. :D #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:53^U
Funny thing is Cochin will get off for taking Shiels out of the game, which is arguably the main reason they are winning #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:56^U
Who would've thought Josh Caddy would leave the Cats to play for the Tigers to play in a Grand Final??!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:59^U
Thx C7 for showing the distance run stats. Top 5 are giants. Proves outside runners don't win games of footy! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:59^U
Umpires handed Footscray the 2016 flag. They look like handing the Tigers the 2017 flag. I'm not blaming the umpires, tho. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:33:59^U

Is there going to be media outrage about the Termites booing Deledio? Or does that only happen for one club? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:06^U

Tigers fans booing Delidio, their life member and 200 gamer, halfway thru last term when game is over  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:23^U

Cotchin coming back on for his last 10 minutes of 2017. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:33^U
I wish we could have a dual volume control so we could turn up the crowd and turn down the commentators lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:34^U
Reckon the crowd started at 95,000.  Less than that now, though.  I'd guess 94,500. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:35^U
No hype from @GWSGIANTS after that goal still 13 minutes in it and the towel already thrown in #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:35^U
If Cotchin doesn't play, &amp; Richmond win the GF,  will Dimmer call him to the dias &amp; give him the coach's medal?  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:39^U
Remind me to get all my neighbors baskets of mini muffins for putting up with me today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:40^U
A night he will never forget, let's hope Cotch gets to remember it for his stellar performance and not for one hard contest #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:40^U
TBH this result is exactly what a team deserves when they bring a fucking brass band into the ground. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:40^U
Richmond supporters booing Deledio, you are absolute scum. Gave you 10 good years and you got a first round pick for him #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:40^U
Simply not enough from Greene, GWS supply inside 50 has been butchered. His the missing link @triplemfooty #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:41^U
This horn section behind the goals should just play the Curb theme tbh #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:46^U
@Steviejohnson20 been a big liability. Done plenty but shoulda parked yourself w dignity 4 prelim. Cost the Giants big. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:34:50^U
#AFLTigersGiants looks like the tigs are getting some momentum. This is the GF I was predicting and absolutely well deserved!! Go tigs^2017-09-23 18:34:55^U

Richmond supporters, why do you have to boo every player from the opposition literally every time they dispose the ball? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:35:12^U
#AFLTigersGiants last year Ward was reeling against the dogs. This year Delidio will reel against Tigers.  Suck it! !!^2017-09-23 18:35:22^U
Richmond proving once again that they can perform without Riewoldt in the side...... shit, he is in the side #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:35:29^U
These umps have done their job. Ruined the game in first 3 quarters. Now they've put the whistle away! Slow learners. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:35:30^U

#AFLTigersGiants this umpiring is fucked. Tigers getting a fortnight to dispose of the ball after a tackle^2017-09-23 18:36:05^U
Seriously, holding the ball does not exist against the Tigers tonight #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:36:05^U
No outrage over Richmond fans booing Deledio, a la Adelaide/Dangerfield? No, of course not.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:36:06^U
Holding the ball surely?? Ridiculous umpiring decisions #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:36:07^U

George at one end, Stevie at the other, 2 pretty ordinary forward games  #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:36:34^U
Richmond booing Deledio is the reason so many other fans don’t like their supporters. No class at all #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:36:39^U
#AFLTigersGiants holding the ball and incorrect disposal is out the window. 2 in a minute inside rich 50^2017-09-23 18:36:39^U

I wouldn't say it's cost GWS the game but I see why people are disgruntled with the umps! Shocking non-calls. - NM #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:28^U
Fuck, the @theheraldsun is going to be insufferable this week. #bandwagon #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:29^U
Ball bounces next to the trainer but it’s Richmond’s trainer so that’s okay #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:30^U
Game is horribly over-umpired  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:32^U

I for one am SHATTERED that a team with only 1300 fans at a sold-out prelim final isn't playing in the Big Dance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:49^U
I know literally fuck all about football but I'm assuming speccy is short for spectacular. Like a spectacular mark #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:49^U
Ellis and Cotchin! Surely gone :/  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:37:49^U

Enjoy your clash strip next weekend like your song says "YELLOW and BLACK" not black and yellow. #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/UmoaaqxhbA^2017-09-23 18:37:52^U
Nice of Brandon Ellis to sacrifice himself for Cotchin.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:37:54^U
Ellis is in trouble for that. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:37:58^U

Why so many empty seats in large areas for a sell out? Not fair on those Tiger fans that missed out #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:08^U
Cotchin and Ellis both out next week. Boy! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:08^U
Well Ellis is gone as well #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:08^U
Forget Cotchin, Ellis is is forked. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:09^U
Another high bump not paid. These umpires are disgraceful. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:09^U
Basil needs to be put in the sea. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:10^U
Ellis has to get a week for that surely - shoulder straight into the chin #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:11^U
Ellis in trouble now as well. Spots up for grabs in the GF team #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:12^U

How was that a fair shot? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:14^U
I don't suggest it has made a marked difference in this game, but wow. I'd prefer last night's umpires to today's #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:14^U
With the finals experience surely GWS are just waiting for Maxwell to lift in this one aren't they? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:15^U

Ouch. Brandon Ellis surely gone. I'd argue Cotchin is too. Disappointing. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:34^U
Richmond might not be able to field a team in the GF as they'll all be rubbed out #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:38:34^U

Did Darcy just call it a Grand Final? #AFLTigersGiants #fuckwit^2017-09-23 18:39:03^U
Ellis and Cotchin would both be almost guaranteed to be looking at a suspension if it was mid season. Let's see this week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:04^U
Tigers lead GWS by 23 with 10m to play in 4th. Rioli with 4 goals, Martin 3.3. Himmelberg and Ward both with 3.1 for Giants #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:05^U
Here they come... #aflfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:07^U

The Giants have soo many quality players but everytime I see Zac Williams I'm super impressed. Absolute 🔫 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:24^U
Plenty of time for the Giants to kick 4 goals and win by a point #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:24^U
To borrow an old phrase: Giants are close enough if they're good enough!  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:39:24^U
Although according to the commentators they're already there #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:25^U

Bloke in the Giants cheersquad wearing a Balmain jersey. An @AFL plant following in the footsteps of Folau and Hunt #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:30^U
If Whitfield playing on aids Ellis then it ruins Cotchin. Can't argue it both ways now. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:32^U
Shut this shit down Tiges ! Stat!#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:32^U

Brandon Ellis mustn't have a brain. 15 minutes left to do nothing stupid and you go and hit Whitfield in the head. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:38^U
Tigers still pushing to get a better percentage. The fear of finishing ninth still lingers.   #AFLTigersGiants #aflfinals^2017-09-23 18:39:38^U
There's a little bit of hope left for a non-Melbourne final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:39^U
How are those undies Tigers fans? If any side can lose it from here.... #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:39:42^U

@SENfooty Suprised they let GWS into the MCG #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:39:46^U
First Cotchin, now Ellis with something to worry about.  I bet Dimma is a little concerned despite the 4 goal lead.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:46^U
@Richmond_FC notify AFL: happy to wear clash jumper in granny if the umpires from their prelim get the gig. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:46^U

Luke Darcy. What a plodder. Says Ellis got Whitfield fairly. Clearly got him in the head. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:51^U
Grimes. Cotchin. Ellis. Will all miss Grand Final through suspension. Nah, the AFL will get them all off. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:39:52^U

The 2017 Grand Final will be the fifth since 2000 to be between 1st &amp; 3rd. 2000, 2010, 2012 &amp; 2013 the others #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:40:41^U

Perfection by Dusty. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:48^U
#AFLTigersGiants ABOUT TIME ROOEY MAKES A MARK^2017-09-23 18:40:51^U
Things starting to get a bit Richmondy... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:52^U
I hope the MRP at @AFL treats the #AFLTigersGiants game like the players always claim as "just like any other game" @FOXFootyLive @7AFL^2017-09-23 18:40:54^U
Would be fitting if Riewoldt sealed the match #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:54^U
Yes Jack! Yes!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:54^U
Riewoldt pulling the old Stevie J trick, downhill skiing all the fucken way once the game is sown up #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:56^U
Dusty has the Midas touch #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:40:57^U
What's grand final week without a review panel decision? Nervous days ahead for Ellis, Cotchin. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:40:57^U
Someone get @DustinMartin4 dad a ticket for next week. Oh wait lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:04^U
Unpaid high contact on Greene in front. Giants will have to do it on their own. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:05^U
Williams has had a shocker #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:07^U
@DHughesy reckon Rioli v Cameron would be a good match up next week. Just head to head. Man'o e man'o #AFLTigersGiants #AFLCrowCats^2017-09-23 18:41:07^U
Ugh. Seeing Richmond’s fans so elated is gonna kill me all week.   Destroy them, Adelaide. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:08^U
That's 2 Richmond players who will be missing the GF not withstanding Melbourne club bias #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:08^U
This game is intense! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:10^U
Welcome to the Preliminary Final, Jack #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:11^U
Crows must wear their home strip as highest finisher @7AFL  @AFL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:13^U
Yeah, nah. Stuff that.  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:41:14^U
No giants players cared enough to see that ball over the line. Tigers now a shot on goal #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:16^U
BS call again, that Tigers blokes foot was clearly on the line  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:16^U
These umpires must really love Richmond... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:16^U
Rioli, Martin and Riewoldt making plays to seal the game. Brilliant. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:18^U
A happy riot is still a riot. Protip: let down your tyres, makes it harder for the mob to flip. #AFLTigersGiants @mickmolloy #peakrichmondy^2017-09-23 18:41:20^U
Not appreciating commentators insinuating that 1982 was a crazy long time ago. It just happened like 15 yrs ago. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:41:21^U
Yesssss Jack!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:25^U
#AFLTigersGiants Ellis and cotchin will take 2 seats in the southern stand next week. Should have to go through the  ballot though^2017-09-23 18:41:26^U
FUCKEN JACK GO YOU GOOD THING. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:27^U
Experiment conclusion: it turns out I do like watching the footy if my team is winning, I've got a book and have drank gin. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:29^U
Yellow and Jack  #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:30^U
Shit Riewoldt is playing! Haven't seen him all game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:31^U
Jack. Cool as you like. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:31^U
Someone had to ask....how does Grimes keep getting a game #AFLTigersGiants . Not nasty....just asking^2017-09-23 18:41:32^U

#AFLTigersGiants goal to JACKYYYYYY 90-61^2017-09-23 18:41:37^U
Greene high tackle not called turns into a Riewoldt mark down the other end, 25m out. Huge moment. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:37^U
@ARB4x4 thoughts on getting ARB tattooed on @DustinMartin4 hand #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:40^U
@AFL umpire told Rucks they can't hit ball over goal line on the full or it's a free. Is he a coach or umpire? #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:42^U
Rioli's little tap won't go done in stats but that was brilliant. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:43^U
ONYA LIL ROOEY #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:44^U
Riewoldt may not get game next week. Down hill skier#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:44^U
@Hymie313 Alex Rance #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:45^U
I didn't even know Reiwoldt was playing #missing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:45^U
Riewoldt pops up when it’s over! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:45^U
So much for that countdown. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:41:46^U
#AFLTigersGiants mighty Jack to the rescue^2017-09-23 18:41:47^U
Jack R has finally appeared! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:48^U
According to Luke Darcy I'm watching a grand final with less than 10 minutes to go #AFLTigersGiants #didntrealise^2017-09-23 18:41:48^U
That kick from Dusty to Riewoldt was top shelf 👏🏻👏🏻 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:49^U
#AFLTigersGiants and there you go - tigers into Grand Final^2017-09-23 18:41:49^U
JACK! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:50^U
When do you know the game is over? When junktime Jack Riewoldt shows up that’s when. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:50^U
something very wrong when a key forward prefers to snap instead of take a drop kick set shot #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:51^U
Richmond supporters still not certain they have it in the bag #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:52^U
Junktime Jack strikes again #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:52^U
could it be true #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:52^U
Rioli has been massive today. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:54^U
Timely goal from Jack Riewoldt. Or, as he is now known, Riewoldt #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:56^U
#AFLTigersGiants Looks like the AFL and umpires have turned their backs on their own team.^2017-09-23 18:41:58^U
my dad just said "surely we win now"   lmao prayin for ya dad #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:58^U
@JackRiewoldt08 does nothing all day and then @DustinMartin4 makes him look like a super star#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:59^U
Who knew that Reiwoldt was playing #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:59^U
#AFLTigersGiants. Go jack  go tigers  Tasmanian home  Old st virgils boy^2017-09-23 18:41:59^U
It's not a tigers win till Jack kicks one.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:41:59^U
Someone put a pot of coffee on for the MRP. They're going to need it..... #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:02^U
So the argument over clash jumpers between @Adelaide_FC and @Richmond_FC begins! #noclash #AFLTigersGiants #AFLGF #weflyasone^2017-09-23 18:42:02^U
Not a great night for Jack but he made that his moment #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:03^U
It's Tiger Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:04^U
Watching the tigers play is no good for my heart not sure I can handle a grand final lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:06^U
No, fair bump - Whitfield just came off second best #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/AiH8mE7CiF^2017-09-23 18:42:09^U
Just as well Jack kicked that. Was in danger of being dropped for next week. #donenothing @OscarMessenger #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:09^U
Lock up your valuables it looks like richmond are going to the grand final #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:10^U

#AFLTigersGiants who cares, up the bloody Parrots. 💚💛 #betterthanCrows^2017-09-23 18:42:13^U
Big Jack just slayed the @GWSGIANTS with that last goal #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals @Richmond_FC^2017-09-23 18:42:15^U
Might need to tune that crowd noise gizmo to a deeper pitch for the boo fest that will occur next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:17^U
Kicking around the body from a set shot needs to disappear. As straight as a shot as you want. Round the body! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:18^U
GWS hasn't impressed me with their defensive efforts. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:19^U
Goal to the Tigers. Lets ignore the high to Greene that should have been a 12 point swing on that eh? LOL #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:23^U
Deledio wondering if he slying put on a Richmond jersey RN if anyone would notice...  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals https://t.co/0TVCPWHX1b^2017-09-23 18:42:24^U
Come on @AFL - this isn't deal or no deal! #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/oOHIFGYy8L^2017-09-23 18:42:24^U
Cannot wait to see how the MRP wriggle out of giving Cotchin a fine #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:28^U
Richmond’s fans can celebrate now - 29 points is too much for the Giants to claw back #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:28^U
Richmond could very well have a few players with a nervous day or two coming up. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:29^U
If the AFL are telling us how to vote, you have to wonder if they're telling the umpires to let Richmond win #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:30^U
That's the sealer.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:29^U
"Not a huge contribution tonight" That's contribution enough Jack Riewoldt #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:30^U
Richmond really missing Vickery tonight 🙄  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:31^U
Richmond fans are like Parra fans... Can come out if the woodwork! #WoW #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:32^U
Tiger time! They're got enough of a buffer now. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:42:33^U
#AFLTigersGiants Lambert has been absolutely huge for the Tigers tonight. Absolute legend. #gotiges^2017-09-23 18:42:36^U

Fair play, #Tiges full of self-belief. Perhaps fairytales do come true. #Bombers #fan #Salute #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:42:44^U

Tigers will win &amp; play in GF but sans Cotchin &amp; Ellis. If MRP have any nuts they'll rightfully rub them out for their hits. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:07^U

Hawks.... I'd b throwing any available dollar at Daniel Rioli when he's off contract...... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:12^U
New franchises time to first premiership:  @WestCoastEagles - 6 years (1st)  @GWSGIANTS 💁🏻‍♂️ (at least 7) 😂  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:43:14^U
Hope @7AFL commentators let the song play out at the final siren #yellowandblack #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:43:15^U

Bring it on, Tiggers!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:19^U
Has anybody considered that @GWSGIANTS might require a few priority picks after this loss? @TitusOReily @IntegrityUnit #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:20^U
RIP Giants season #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:20^U
I'm sure the AFL will flick GWS some more early draft picks to make sure they win the flag next year instead #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:21^U
So Ellis &amp; Cotchin gone for next week. But usual afl lap dogs @SENfooty @triplemfooty won't call afl out on inconsistency #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:22^U
No Cotchin (suspended), no Martin (hip) next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:22^U
#AFLTigersGiants Dusty 'Dont argue' practise. https://t.co/LuTcC7zNmA^2017-09-23 18:43:23^U
Not even Richmond could Richmond it from here...  The Tigers are into the Grand Final!!!!! 🐯  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:43:24^U
Have the umpires let Richmond win? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:24^U
And there it is.... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:24^U
they need to ban Castegna instead of Kotchin and Ellis :D #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:26^U
Cotchin has been inspirational. Standing ovation as he ran to bench. Richmond may riot if he faces suspension ahead of GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:27^U
Nearly there @Richmond_FC 96-61 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:28^U
Where are @Richmond_FC fans gonna get the money for GF tickets? They are all junkies  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:28^U
Game. Set. Match. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:28^U
Jack Riewoldt must feel like an enormous failure that he'll never be as famous as his brother is for having a blond wang #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:29^U
I WANT TO BELIEVE #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:31^U
Cotchin BOG, followed by Rioli and Grimes IMO. Martin the icing on the cake #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:43:31^U

Can we start taking bets on how many times people say "fairytale" in the next 7 days? #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:34^U
That's gotta be it.  Still think Crows will destroy them.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:34^U
Kelly probably regrets turning down Norths offer now #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:35^U
So the #Crows have a GF against a team we smashed by 12 goals when we last faced them. I'm ok with that #AFLGF #weflyasone #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:35^U
You know what I think is missing from the commentary- some mention of the crowd or the noise 😶#AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:35^U
#AFLTigersGiants Tiger fans - enjoy the week - feels surreal!! Go Dogs 2016^2017-09-23 18:43:35^U

In a pub full of Mad Richmond fans. Wouldn't have it any other way. They have waited 35 years since going to the Granny.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:45^U
For a team that hasn't made a GF since 1982, they sure are a bunch of arrogant cunts #AFLTigersGiants #gocrows^2017-09-23 18:43:45^U

🐯 going to the GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:43:53^U

Two prelims in a row two costly concussions limiting rotations, takes its toll #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:44:07^U
No wonder @WestCoastEagles fans wanted Willie Rioli in for the #AFLFinals  - it's in the surname! September magic. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:44:10^U

I reckon this loss is really gonna hurt GWS's premiership chances. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:44:22^U
Gws have been slow &amp; uneasy. So many poor kicks &amp; handballs. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:44:22^U
Richmond are in the GF, it's kinda surreal. But, also kinda cool. Will still be barracking for the Crows though #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:44:22^U

Is it a good time to point out, that the last time Richmond was in a grand final, they lost to @CarltonFC  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:07^U
Can someone in the Giants camp let Josh Kelly know that if he needs consoling I am available. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:45:10^U
I've never been more disgusted in a game of football than I have been today #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:13^U

Well done @GWSGIANTS - turning it over in defensive 50 repeatedly. Again. And again! Genius. Pure genius. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:45:18^U
Fair play Tigers - don’t like you , but well deserved.  let’s hope Pykes boys can extend nearly 40 years of pain next week  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:19^U
Biggest tragedy about this game - the majority of the hard-core fans there won't get to see their team in the GF #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:20^U
A fighting fury. Tigers in the grand final. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:22^U
Bad news Brandon Ellis, you’re going to be the sacrificial lamb that gets 2 weeks so Cotchin can get off #fixed #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:23^U
126dB in case you missed it @declanf. Lingy must have dashed out to 7/11 for more batteries. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:24^U
Darcy says "GWS have been brave". Bullshit. Failed again losers 😂😀 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:24^U
So that's it then. It's a Crows vs Tigers Grand Final. Should be a cracking game, very much looking forward to it. - NM #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:45:24^U

To be honest, I feel like other than Swans, Tigers were the only other team who could give the Crows a run for their money. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:47:15^U

@Ahlephia has it dawned on you yet that you're going to the GRAND FINAL!? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:08^U
Well, Adelaide vs Richmond in the GF next week. That'll be great. The two teams I've enjoyed watching the most this year.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:08^U
And THAT’S why it’s been 35 years between finals for Richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:08^U
Maybe before the game Cotch thought he'd sacrifice himself by taking out the Giants best player..game plan #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:15^U

Great win but Tigers have a lot of players who don't want to shoot for goal... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:27^U
Dusty on the water at the #Brownlow is disappointing. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:48:27^U

Q: How many people will be out in Richmond tonight? #AFLTigersGiants   A: https://t.co/eHFQXvY1er^2017-09-23 18:48:38^U
Tigers a little overzealous sharing the ball around close to goal and come unstuck at times. Can't afford that next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:39^U
Remember 12 months ago when all these Muppet Richmond supporters wanted Hardwick sacked? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:42^U
Just something so gratifying seeing an arrogant bunch of men with self entitlement written all over them fail. Fuck off GWS #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:42^U
You've had a great year GWS &amp; worthy of being at the prelim final. Best luck for next year fans #carnthetiges 🐯🖤💛 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:43^U
Not wanting to be a Debbie Downer but ... some of Castagna's disposal is just horrible. He miskicked it 3 metres before #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:45^U
In a minor note of nitpicking.....Castanya needs to work on his handballs. Put his teammates under pressure all night.#AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:45^U
Oh @Richmond_FC, I am so excited for you!! The boys have been incredible tonight. Next week is going to be off the charts #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:48:45^U

Stevie J should not be playing. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:49:16^U
If 'best on ground' means having a big impact &amp; role on the game, the umpiring team are a shoo-in for this accolade. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:49:16^U

I'm going to really miss Steve Johnson. "Last of his kind" is an overused phrase, but it's apt in Johnson's case #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:49:46^U
Cotchin will surely get at least a fine and that means he is out due to the 3 strikes? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:49:47^U

GWS looked cooked in the 3rd,all Tigers from that point on. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:50:53^U
Big on multiple fronts for Richmond in #VFL GF tomorrow, could be a few AFL GF positions up for grabs #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants #PJVFL^2017-09-23 18:50:54^U
A true tigers supporter would still question whether they could make it from here #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:50:54^U

It's a concern these umpires are ranked in the top 6 for the year... #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:51:00^U
7 goals up with a minute to play - "The Tigers are into the Grand Final". You don't say, Basil? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:01^U

Hmmmmm. Was #AFLTigersGiants a good game or did the crappy finals continue? 🤔  The crowd and Tigers story was what made it entertaining.^2017-09-23 18:51:11^U
#AFLTigersGiants what a fucking game^2017-09-23 18:51:13^U

Getting weirdly emotional about a team I don't support. A special time of year, this  #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:51:19^U
Happy for the Tigers having said that i hope they lose by 1 point in the GF! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals #weflyasone^2017-09-23 18:51:22^U

Afl to interrupt Richmond celebrations to announce 2 priority picks for GWS in draft #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:28^U
Cotchin and Ellis #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/896v3s4iof^2017-09-23 18:51:29^U
Trent Cotchin willed his team into the Grand Final. Whether he plays or not on Saturday, he's a true leader. #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:29^U
Absolute fizzer of a finals series in both codes, pumpings galore #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:30^U
Not sure if GWS even turned up for the fourth quarter? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:30^U
Phenomenal game by Daniel Rioli! 🔥👏 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:30^U

@LifeAsSuch_ I did. About 30 minutes ago! 😂😂😂 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:46^U
Crows, two to beat next week; Richmond and Vic-centric umpires #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:47^U
Im emotional and it isnt our boys. Love this game #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:48^U
Over 50 free kicks paid this game. Umpiring apologists - yes you may have an extension on your homework, you'll need it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:48^U
@7AFL @MCG Basil has been saying “THE TIGERS ARE IN THE GRAND FINAL” for the last 32mins... 🙄 #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:49^U

Congratulations Tigers fans now do us Power supporters a favour and take home the cup. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:55^U
94,258 is less than 95,000 isn't it or does Luke Darcy know something about mathematics that I don't? #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:51:55^U
So now the focus will be on if Cotch plays or not #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:56^U
I'd be so bitter if I were a Giants fan, weren't given a chance #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:51:56^U
Hawthorn were a premiership team prior to this year. Richmond were a basket case prior to this team. Vickery the reason. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:51:56^U
#AFLTigersGiants says it all when Richo says " who would've thought the teams with the longest drought would be in the gf?!!!!" Rigged afl!^2017-09-23 18:51:57^U
#AFLTigersGiants if Toby Greene got off on a jump kick to face Cotchen is super safe^2017-09-23 18:51:59^U
Thanks to all the grand final corporate tickets you're never going to hear a crowd like this again. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:00^U

Cotchin watching GF next from coaches box  #AFLfinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:09^U
Still hoping the true Tigers supporters get to be there next week. The ones who didn't dump on their club when it was down #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:09^U
Was Costagna realistically going for the ball there?? This is crazy stuff. Hope tiger fans aren't expecting bias next week #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:16^U
This is karma coming back to bite Tony Greene in the ass. Maybe GWS will work on their bully issues in the off season. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:16^U
There is now a distinct possibility that Tigers fans just won't leave the MCG. #Possesion9TenthsOfTheLaw #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:19^U
Well done Richmond 👍🏻 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:52:20^U

Richo!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:28^U
Absolutely mental. Next week will be the first time nobody on the ground has ever played in a GF since the first GF in 1898 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:28^U
Have the Tiges just played their Granny? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:28^U
Richmond finished No.13 on 2016 #AFL ladder, but next week will play in their first Grand Final in 35 years #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:30^U
Richmond are into their first Grand Final in 35 years. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:31^U
LOUD NOISES IN THE COMMS BOX #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:31^U
Matthew Richardson just about exploded #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:32^U
Richmond, the only team to finish 3rd and have 3/3 home ground advantages #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:53:33^U
Someone needs to tell commentators that this noise won't be replicated in GF.  Only 33000 members get to go. #AFLFinals  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:34^U
Reckon Danger and Lids should get together for the GF #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:53:34^U
Good onya Tiges, now go on with it #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:36^U
Jack Riewoldt ugly crying... #lol #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:37^U
You have a mic Infront of you no need to scream. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:38^U
Can't wait to see whether Cotchin gets the Barry Hall on Matt Maguire treatment or the Anthony Rocca treatment on Monday. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:39^U
Richo is straight jerking his dick on live TV right now. Homeboy crying and jacking it hard! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:39^U
This doesn't feel real! Yellow and black baby! Never in doubt! #Richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:40^U
Fitting that Stevie Johnson finishes his career having a shocker. What a grub of a player. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:40^U
Whoever just said "I can't" in response to "Can you believe it?" on C7's commentary needs to be sacked. #AFLFinals #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:53:41^U

Hopefully the boys will produce the performance of a lifetime next week, will take it to knock this mob off at the G.  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:03^U
Richo, you should be questioning why he never made a Grand Final, rather than celebrating, you talentless shit #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:03^U
Careful tiges. Over celebrating way too soon. Keep the lid on one more week. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:04^U

Wtf channel 7 that is awful #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:46^U
Deledio gave the best years of his career to the tigers, only to have them make a GF after he leaves. Footy is a bitch #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:46^U
Excellent sportsmanship at the end. Really nice, boys #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:47^U

Oops. Who just played the wrong song? Saved in the nick of time!! Another great performance Richmond! #yellowandblack #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:54:53^U

Nothing like playing the first 5 seconds of the Giants' song just to rub it in. MCG, you cold bastard. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:55:00^U
WE ARE IN THE FINAL!! #gotiges #AFLTigersGiants #AFLGF^2017-09-23 18:55:00^U

Crows for the flag! #weflyasone #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:55:06^U
Was the 5 seconds of the GWS song some deliberate trolling of the tigers fans? Come on they've waited long enough... #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:55:07^U
YELLOW AND BLACK!! So proud of the boys!! 🐯🐯🐯 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:55:08^U

I said mid-week Stevie J would be a liability. Proven true. How he played ahead of Devon Smith is BEYOND me #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:57:34^U
Excellent guard if honour for Stevie Johnston.  Well done #Tigers #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:57:35^U
Too bad Cotchin won't play the GF though...Thoughts @tim_parham ? #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:57:35^U
Richo pulling out the same line as Darce a year ago 'can you believe it'! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals @7AFL^2017-09-23 18:57:36^U
Cotchin doesn't know he's not playing yet 😞 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 18:57:36^U

Usually when I don't like a footy team it's because of the fans. With @Richmond_FC it's the players #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:59:48^U
THAT GOAL AFTER THE SIREN WON ME $21!!!!! #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/mapYSUp4rw^2017-09-23 18:59:49^U
GWS will just have to go back to the drawing board or as its also known their ridiculously talent-laden academy zones #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:59:50^U
Fans staying after the game to cheer the Tigers and sing their team song is amazing, in Sydney we get out to get home #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:59:51^U
Not even the big dance.. As a West Coast faithful, I have full respect for the Richmond Football Club. I have your back. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:59:53^U
FUCKING GOOD ON YOU TIGES 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 18:59:54^U

Very strange of @GWSGIANTS to omit @TobyfGreene, and @Steviejohnson20 for the biggest game of the club's history. 😅 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:12:19^U

And now I switch from 95000 fans at the AFL to 25000 fans at the NRL, not quite the same. #AFLTigersGiants #nrlroosterscowboys^2017-09-23 19:12:58^U
Well if you don't believe in god. Tonight I witnessed close to 90,000 people put their faith in one man, Dusty! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:12:58^U

what a joke, fuck richmond #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:21^U
It's always amazing when a generation of bandwagon tigers fans' children from the 70's/80's get something to cheer for. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:21^U
The real winner of the game was the guy sitting behind us who got walked in Q3 for byo booze but then reappeared in Q4 #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:24^U
So at what point were the Giants supposed to become this unstoppable juggernaut winning all the premierships #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:26^U

from watching the @AFL prelim between #AFLTigersGiants to now watching this @NRL #nrlroosterscowboys .... what a atmospheric drop.^2017-09-23 19:13:32^U
Hardwick proves that Rome wasn't built in a day. Credit to the heavy hitters at Richmond for sticking by their man! #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:33^U

Just switched the TV on to watch the Tigers against GWS. FFS.  Why was this not a night game?!  #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:13:57^U
Your boys are off to the big dance @Tigstweet! #woohoo #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:14:09^U
That's it, I'm jumping on #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:14:12^U
Good news, Richmond fans. Every previous team to beat GWS in a preliminary final has gone on to win the flag. #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 19:14:19^U
The Giants pea-hearted defensive efforts in that game is why they lost #AFLTigersGiants   #AllCreamNoMilk  #downhillskiers^2017-09-23 19:14:23^U
Since I have a Richmond @Foxtel remote for some reason, I'm backing the Tigers in the big one! #AFLTigersGiants #AFLFinals^2017-09-23 19:14:27^U
Over to you MRP 🤔 #AFLTigersGiants #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:14:41^U
Vote yes because Damien Hardwick has just proposed Dan Rioli. #AFLTigersGiants^2017-09-23 19:14:42^U
Bit like TIGES Leaving Resolution out. Hilarious #AFLTigersGiants https://t.co/qlKNCWIXf2^2017-09-23 19:14:45^U
