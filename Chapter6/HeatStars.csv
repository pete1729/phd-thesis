I do like to see Brendon McCullum go off. #BBL07^2017-12-20 19:18:57^U
McCullum has nothing to prove. Peirson would be keen to get some runs though #BBL07^2017-12-20 19:19:03^U

So hang on why doesn‚Äôt Ben Cutting to change his helmet after getting hit on the lid? Isn‚Äôt that the policy? #BBL07^2017-12-20 20:30:26^U
A full toss from Hastings gets dispatched into the middle deck of the Gabba. #BBL07^2017-12-20 20:30:28^U
